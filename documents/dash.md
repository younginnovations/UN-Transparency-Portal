Dash
==========================================

Dash is an overview of the data populating d-portal.org with a focus primarily on publisher statistics and the quality of the data reported by them.

By showing you when and where invalid data is reported, Dash will be able to explain the gaps that are reflected on the main site.

These **gaps** include, but not limited to:

- Invalid country recipients, where a publisher reports a country that is not found under ISO3166 Alpha-2 (live)
- Invalid sectors (not live)
- Percentage of activities with exact locations (not live)
- Budgets with invalid dates (not live)
- Transactions with invalid dates (not live)
- Currencies reported (not live)


Dash is not country specific so you will be able to view all of the publisher statistics available across all countries included in the portal. This is to accomodate the fact that there are multiple publishers that report activities in multiple recipient countries.

Dash is currently accessible at http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?#view=dash.

Dash updates everyday GMT +0 with new data fetched from the IATI Registry.

Dash will soon do a full import every week on Sunday GMT +0.

Dash is best used with other dashboards to see the gaps; ie. http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/

Dash is a new feature and is still being developed.
