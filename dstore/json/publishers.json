Our primary accountability is to people living in poverty and injustice, but we also balance our accountabilities to donors, supporters, staff and other stakeholders.    ActionAid UK’s income comes from a variety of sources including from our 135,000 individual supporters, trusts and foundations, and institutions like DfID, and the EU. Ongoing regular donations from the public represent a particularly critical element of our funding mix - both in terms of proportion of our global income, but also in terms of its potential for both transformational and focused change.  We use our funding mix holistically to deliver results in the communities in which we work.  In addition, we use unrestricted income for activities which support the International Secretariat which supports 46 countries across the ActionAid Federation. \r\n\r\nIn 2013 we raised £63.7 million, seeing a seven per cent increase in our income.  For every £10 of the money we raised, £7.54 was spent on our charitable activity – £7.00 on our activities overseas and 54 pence in the UK on education outreach to schools and on campaigning. Of the remainder, £1.85 was spent on fundraising and 61 pence on UK support costs. \r\n\r\n \r\nActionAid UK’s data that’s published to the IATI registry is summarised under the six categories above as this corresponds directly with our Trustee Report & Accounts for 2013 (and is therefore based on audited data): \r\n\r\nhttp://www.actionaid.org.uk/about-us/trustees-report-and-accounts.  \r\n\r\nAs we align our IATI reporting with our Trustee Report & Accounts, the bulk of our reporting to IATI is annual.  We report on DfID contracts quarterly.\r\n \r\n",

			"publisher_data_quality": "The data ActionAid UK is publishing to the IATI website is of 2015 income (as in the past) and also expenditure on institutional donors and DEC. This data aligns with ActionAid UK trustee report and accounts 2015. The published data covers all core fields under the IATI/DFID standards. Where income has been accrued as required by SORP 2015, this has been treated as committed as opposed to incoming funds in the data.\r\nAs our income comes from hundreds of thousands of individual people, community groups, trusts and foundations, we have not published their names as we do not have their permission to disclose their identity and details. We therefore have anonymised the data published to the IATI registry where that’s appropriate. Naturally we have disclosed information relating to official income from organisations such as DfID, EU, ECHO, Comic Relief, and Big Lottery. Our income from private individuals (committed giving) involves regular ongoing cash or direct debit payments and a large proportion of our loyal supporter base stay with us for many years. However, the IATI data format requires to enter start and end dates. Given that it is not easy to represent an ongoing income stream in IATI (and after having taken advice from IATI on how best to do this), we have stated start and end dates of 1st January and 31st December against all committed giving. Data for committed giving and Appeals has been summarised by beneficiary code summarised by product, for each month per country e.g. January child sponsorship – Nepal - £XX.\r\nFor expenditure, data has been supplied only for DEC and Govs/EU grants and contract funds. Expenditure and disbursement data has not been provided for Appeals, NGOs, Committed Giving and Other.\r\nAlthough the data in the registry is based on audited data and quality checks have been undertaken before publication, it is possible that there may be some inaccuracies. Please contact transparency@actionaid.org if you have any comments or queries. \r\n"

Over the past three years, the fund has dedicated more than US$ 190 million to increase climate resilience in 28 countries around the world.\r\n \r\n  Climate change is increasing the burdens of the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. \r\n \r\n  Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives\r\n",

Afghanaid directly implements projects in four provinces, namely Badakhshan (north-eastern region), Samangan (northern region), Ghor (western region) and Nuristan (eastern region). Afghanaid currently works with local NGOs in three provinces in the southern region, namely Kandahar, Ghazni and Uruzgan. ",

For current financial year (April to December 2013) the percentage of these two grants is about 17% in total  budgeted for this period. This 9 month financial year is due to the fact that Afghanaid is in the process of modifying its financial year from April to March to January to December as required by the Afghanistan Government.",

The mission of the Agência do Zambeze, which was established in 2010, is to promote the socio-economic and sustainable development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. This Basin comprises 34 districts in four provinces: Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezi. In addition to these districts the Agency’s geographical remit also comprise 6 districts that fall outside the River Basin area. \r\n\r\nFollowing Decree No. 23/2010 of June 2010 the ZVDA is mandated to act in three areas:\r\n\r\n•\tUndertake studies and present strategies for the socio-economic development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. \r\n•\tProvide technical and financial assistance to socio-economic development initiatives in the Lower Zambezi River Basin, including mobilizing funds for such initiatives and channelling them to beneficiaries. \r\n•\tProvide support to local governments in local land use planning and socio-economic development\r\n\r\nThe management of the Agency has taken the strategic decision to facilitate, rather than to implement development projects. By means of national and international tenders, public and private partners are invited to apply to undertake the projects. To a limited extent, ZVDA staff or consultants are charged with project management tasks.\r\n\r\nThe Agency seeks to play a decisive role in coordinating the relationship between the partners, funders, implementing agencies and beneficiaries. Therefore, information collection and sharing, supervision and monitoring of projects and programmes are key tasks.\r\n",

			"publisher_record_exclusions": "IATI exclusion policy\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands values transparency and accountability. Therefore Amnesty International - The Netherlands decided to publish its project data. Amnesty International - The Netherlands commits itself to publish its project data set compliant to the IATI standard. The first IATI compliant project data set will be published at no later than 30-04-2016. The projects that ran in the period 01-01-2016 and 30-03-2016 will be included in the data set. Amnesty International - The Netherlands embraces the principle “Open, unless…”. This means that Amnesty International - The Netherlands remains to have the right to exclude project information from publication to IATI if it falls in one of the following categories:\r\n•\tInformation disclosure affecting relations between partner organization and government/other NGOs (human rights work or work in some conflict affected states);\r\n•\tDetailed specific information affecting and jeopardizing the safety and security of NGO staff, partner staff or beneficiaries;\r\n•\tPersonal information of individual staff and/or partners (e.g. addresses and telephone numbers);\r\n•\tCommercially sensitive information (salaries, consultant fees);\r\n•\tInformation that is exempt under data protection laws or by pre-existing organizational policies.\r\n2. Articles\r\n2.1 General principles for exclusion\r\nExternal relations\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, authorities  or institutions of Amnesty International - The Netherlands, its partners or other donors. All partner organizations and donors\r\nare informed on forehand about Amnesty International - The Netherlands’s policies concerning publishing project data . All the parties have the possibility to request exclusion on forehand, based on the principles in this exclusion policy. Amnesty International - The Netherlands is, at all times, the final decision-maker for the exclusion of data.\r\nSecurity\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data of which it can be expected that it might pose a risk to\r\nthe safety and/or security of any individuals, local Amnesty International - The Netherlands offices, groups of beneficiaries, partner\r\norganizations, donors or suppliers. From a security point of view it was decided to\r\npublish transaction on a cumulative basis per quarter per activity.\r\nPrivacy\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish any information which is traceable to an individual person and that violates that person’s privacy without obtaining prior consent of that specific person involved.\r\nCommercial/Strategic\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that might harm the commercial or strategic interests of Amnesty International - The Netherlands,\r\nits partners, donors or suppliers. Information about the conditions and repayments of loans, investments and guarantees is part of this exclusion and will therefore not be published by Amnesty International - The Netherlands.\r\nLegal/Contractual\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data if we do not have the right to publish the data. Amnesty International - The Netherlands will not publish the data if Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not hold the copyright on particular information or if contractual agreements with back donors or partner organizations impede Amnesty International - The Netherlands’s right to publish the data.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands publishes all project data of projects started after 01-01-2016  or ongoing projects\r\nwith new commitments of more than EUR 25,000 in 2016. \r\nSocial impact\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that possibly harms the social impact of Amnesty International - The Netherlands in general or the related project in particular.\r\nOpenness and transparency about the exclusion policy\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands is transparent about the exclusion policy that Amnesty International - The Netherlands applies to its published IATI compliant data set. This policy is therefore published on the publicly accessible website of Amnesty International - The Netherlands: www.paxvoorvrede.nl.\r\nPublished activities \r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands will report all its projects as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier. However, other information might not be included if one or more categories that are mentioned in this exclusion policy apply. \r\nData Quality\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands values the quality and consistency of its open data. Therefore Amnesty International - The Netherlands publishes only\r\nproject data that meet the minimum requirements. The data quality concerning e.g. reliability will be assessed by program officers. Data that does not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.\r\n3. Decision-making on excluding data\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands has the right to exclude data. Information will be disclosed unless a project officer decides otherwise. The responsibility for excluding information is at the level where the information can be assessed in detail. It is possible to exclude a particular project, specific information fields of the IATI standard and/or specific documents from disclosure in the project administration. \r\n4. Review of exclusion policy and quality of data\r\nOn a quarterly basis the planning, monitoring and evaluation department of Amnesty International - The Netherlands will review all data excluded from disclosure. It will be reviewed whether data are rightly excluded and if the exclusion policy is still valid. The exclusion policy will be reviewed and if necessary adjusted on an annual basis.",

				"about": "A Brief Introduction to BASE\r\n\r\nBASE – Our History\r\n\r\nThe origins of Backward Society Education (BASE) are to be found in a pioneering group of young activists who established the Charpate Club in January 1985.  It was during their traditional Tharu New Year meeting in the village of Dumrigaon in Dang that the thirty four young people, including our founder Dill Bahadur Chaudhary, gathered together to discuss the problem of kamaiya bonded labor.  After raising 700 rupees through cultural shows, the Charpate Club went on to become BASE in 1990, and to lead the fight against the exploitative kamaiya system which was finally abolished on 17 July 2000.  After this monumental event BASE continued to work for the education and rehabilitation of the freed-kamaiyas, as well as people from other marginalized communities.  BASE has received international recognition for its work, and Dilli Chaudhary has won many awards including the 1994 Reebok Human Rights Award and the 2002 Anti Slavery Award. sought \r\n\r\nBASE – The NGO\r\n\r\nBASE continues in its commitment to fight against illiteracy, poverty and social and political discrimination amongst all marginalized communities.  Our aim is to transform the outlook of downtrodden people as well as their oppressors.  We currently operate in eight districts in the mid and far western regions of Nepal, those being Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali, Kanchanpur, Salyan, Surkhet and Rukum.  However, we are now considering expanding our projects into other districts.  Our main areas of work include formal and non-formal education, ensuring and sustaining rights for freed-kamaiyas, livelihood support, child labor elimination, support for sustainable democracy, human rights violation monitoring, conflict mitigation, water and sanitation, environmental sustainability, disaster preparedness and response, infrastructure support, the protection and promotion of traditional and indigenous cultures, and support for children associated with armed groups.  BASE hires its staff primarily from the local communities of indigenous and marginalized people it serves, and in doing so it works to strengthen indigenous capabilities. Advance\r\n\r\nBASE – The Social Movement\r\n\r\nBASE is not just an NGO but one of the largest social movements in South Asia.  We have a membership of over 200,000 people, of which about 29,000 are actively engaged in voluntary community work.  BASE’s membership is organized through a network of district committees, area committees, village committees, women’s awareness committees and youth awareness committees, all operating at their own respective level and in their own areas.  These grassroots committee members are democratically elected every five years, and they provide the strategies and ideas to keep BASE in touch with the current needs of our communities.  The committees also play a crucial role in monitoring and evaluation, troubleshooting, coordinating with national and international agencies, and communication and exposure of BASE in the diplomatic sphere.  The power of BASE’s membership is even further enhanced by hundreds of child clubs, women’s groups, income generation groups and other community organizations.\r\n\r\nBackward Society Education (BASE), Tulsipur Municipality-6, Dang, Rapti Zone, Nepal \r\nT +977 82 520055, 82 520312 F +977 82 522212 E info@nepalbase.org W www.nepalbase.org\r\n\r\n",

Five years after the struggle, the bonded labor system was officially abolished in Nepal following the government committed to rehabilitate and provide them compensation in terms of land, creation of employment opportunity and education for their children. This was a huge achievements for the ex bonded labour who were deprived of their rights and entitlements under various alibis for ages. Unfortunately, the lack of effective implementation of the commitment has remained a major challenge and as a result the great majority of ex bonded labour continue to suffer with no sign of relenting. Hence, the project jointly has implemented by the BASE as lead applicant and WVAF as partner organization have envisioned ameliorating the situation that has remained a long overdue. Moreover, the project will also contribute in achieving some of the goals of MDG by addressing the problem of ex-Kamaiya related with child labour and unemployment/underemployment through livelihood support, education, holding duty bearers to account and capacity building of Kamaiya leaders.

			"publisher_description": "The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is one of the fastest and most effective ways to support rapid humanitarian response for people affected by natural disasters and armed conflict. CERF receives voluntary contributions year-round to provide immediate funding for life-saving humanitarian action anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nERF pools contributions from donors – mainly governments, but also, foundations, companies, charities and individuals – into a single fund with a $450 million annual target.\r\n\r\nThis money is set aside for immediate use at the onset of emergencies, in rapidly deteriorating situations and in protracted crises that fail to attract sufficient resources.\r\n\r\nIn emergencies, humanitarian organizations apply jointly for funding. Funds are immediately released if these proposals meet CERF’s criteria, i.e. the needs are urgent and the proposed activities will save lives.\r\n\r\nWith money available immediately, relief organizations can deliver food, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other life-saving aid faster and more efficiently.\r\n\r\nCERF allocations are designed to complement other humanitarian funding sources, such as country-based pooled funds and bilateral funding.\r\n\r\nCERF makes money available when it is needed most: at the beginning of a crisis, when time is of the essence and it is critical that emergency relief operations get under way quickly.\r\n\r\nBut mobilizing funds can take time and as time passes, more lives are lost.\r\nCERF helps to remedy this problem with rapid response grants, which can be approved in as little as 48 hours.\r\n\r\nCERF provides funding to the world’s most neglected crises. When a disaster fades from the headlines, or never makes the headlines, it is much harder to raise funds. The need for help, however, is no less significant.\r\n\r\nCERF helps to address this challenge with underfunded emergencies grants, which are disbursed twice a year for emergencies that have not attracted sufficient funding.\r\n\r\nCERF has a loan facility of $30 million. Up to one-year loans are provided based on indication that donor funding is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIn an average year, CERF allocates approximately $450 million to humanitarian operations in some 50 different countries. Since 2006, more than $3.7 billion has been allocated to help millions of people in 92 countries and territories across the world.\r\n\r\nCERF funding is available to UN agencies, funds and programmes and the International Organization for Migration.\r\n\r\nNGOs are important partners in the CERF allocation decision making processes and receive CERF funding when they carry out work for recipient organizations.\r\n\r\nCERF is funded by voluntary contributions. Since 2006, CERF has received almost $3.8 billion from 125 UN Member States and observers, regional and local authorities, and other public and private donors. A third of CERF’s contributors have also received support from the fund.\r\n\r\nThe Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) manages CERF on behalf of the UN Secretary-General.\r\n\r\nThe ERC is supported by the CERF secretariat, which is situated within the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe CERF secretariat is responsible for ensuring that the funds are allocated properly, disbursed in a timely manner, and that use of the funds is reported appropriately and transparently.\r\n\r\nThe CERF Advisory Group provides policy guidance to the Secretary-General on the use and impact of the fund.",

Identifying that food is the best medicine, they believed that developing small-scale agriculture is the key to reducing rural poverty. In 1987, Farm Africa started work with nomadic pastoralists in the remote north of Kenya, expanding to Ethiopia a year later.  \r\n\r\nFarm Africa believes that Africa has the power to feed itself and that its smallholders hold the key to lasting rural prosperity. We work directly with farmers to help them unleash their potential to feed Africa’s people.  We pioneer techniques that boost harvests, reduce poverty, sustain natural resources and help end Africa’s need for aid.  \r\n\r\nFarm Africa has 200 staff operating across the east African countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.  Farm Africa’s local staff provide the tools and expertise to enable smallholders in eastern Africa to increase their harvests, whether they farm crops, livestock, fish or the forest.  We train them to be more commercial, adding value to surpluses by milling, drying, or turning their produce into products that fetch a higher price.  With better food for their families and reliable incomes from their businesses, farmers can build for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Its sources of support, integration, association and target have grown to cover the broader community structures. Initial focus on HIV has been expanded to cover broader developmental issues such as livelihoods, wider health concern, capacity development and research. Overally, FACT has graduated from its day of inception to become one of the broad based national NGOs supporting communities and development needs of Zimbabwe and the region.\r\n",

			"publisher_description": "The FMS was created in 2007 to promote women's rights through the investment in women-led organisations. The FMS is the only women’s fund of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay that led women’s groups and movements working to achieve long– term social change. The FMS´s missionis to mobilize financial and technical resources and strengthen organisational capacities of women's organisations in situation of most socio-economic, cultural and environmental disadvantages in Latin America and the Southern Cone, which aim to advance gender equality as the path for a just and equitable social change.\r\n\r\nThe FMS supports women’s groups and organisations and women right’s defenders to advance women’s rights and gender equality in Latin America, with focus on the southern cone sub region. It has two key mandates (i) mobilizing international and local resources and grantmaking towards women’s rights work; (ii) building social movement with capacity development towards social change. \r\n\r\nThe FMS mobilizes resources to support women’s rights groups and organisations through direct and flexible grants from an equal and transparent partnership, based on the conviction that women have enormous potential to be agents of social change. We believe that if women and their organisations are empowered to defend their rights and access to equal opportunities to fulfill their potential, we will contribute with inclusive, participative and sustainable models of development and wellbeing at the community level. \r\n\r\nTo ensure the realization of its mission, the FMS focuses on:  \r\n\r\n-Empowering women’s of most disadvantaged groups decision making and political agency by both strengthening their organizing and advocacy skills and supporting the development of inclusive and democratic leaderships, respectful of diversity and multiculturality and with regional and subregional-wide visions.\r\n\r\n- Supporting exclusively groups and organisations led and composed by women of the most disadvantaged groups in societies and fund controversial and traditionally marginalized and invisibilized issues at the community level; such as labour rights of women workers from precarious sectors like domestic and sewing workers; environmental rights of indigenous women’s rights defenders; criminalization of women’s human rights defenders and activists; LGTTTBI, among others.\r\n\r\n-Influencing community philanthropy and development aid sectors to increase the resources available for women’s human rights initiatives. The ultimate goal is to impact the culture of philanthropy in Latin America from a sustainable, participatory and inclusive development approach with focus on raising awareness about women’s human rights; thus changing the social landscape. \r\n\r\n",

More information about IATI and its objectives is available on the IATI website.\r\n\r\nFree a Girl is first focusing on publishing data on projects receiving funding from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Data from projects with other funding sources and donors are therefore excluded from publication at this stage.  \r\n\r\nFree a Girl adheres to the principle of ‘Open, unless…’, whereby data on project activities are excluded from publication on IATI if the information falls under one of the following categories: \r\n\r\n1.\tProjects that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Netherlands\r\nFree a Girl publishes all projects funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Other projects and programmes are not published in the beginning. This policy will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. \r\n2.\tSafety and security \r\nIf the information disclosed could reasonably pose a threat to the safety and security of any individuals, such as project beneficiaries, partner organisations, Free a Girl staff or donors, it is excluded. This could include but is not limited to, specific locations of project activities and addresses of local partner offices and so forth. \r\n3.\tHarmful for project activities \r\nInformation that would cause harm or jeopardise the implementation or success of project activities is not disclosed. Given the work of Free a Girl in the area of commercial sexual exploitation, this could include information, for example, about targets of future rescue raid operations or advocacy activities.  \r\n4.\tExternal relations\r\nFree a girl does not publish information that may negatively affect relationships with partner organisations, donors and other key stakeholders. Partner organisations and back donors related to projects that are published on IATI are informed of Free a Girl’s policies for publishing project data and can request exclusion. \r\n\r\n5.\tConfidentiality and privacy\r\nInformation that can be traced to an individual, constitutes an invasion of privacy, or may be confidential due to legal, commercial or contractual reasons, is not disclosed. \r\n6.\tCost-effectiveness \r\nFree a Girl does not publish data where the time or monetary costs of obtaining and publishing the data outweigh the expected social impact or public benefit. \r\n7.\tHistory\r\nFree a Girl publishes data from projects funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that commenced after 30 June 2015. Projects prior to this date and that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are excluded at this stage. \r\n\r\nReviews and decision-making \r\nA review of this exclusion policy is conducted on a quarterly basis by the programmes manager and staff, in order to keep abreast of new requirements and changes in internal policies. Decision-making regarding publication of data and exclusions is done by the programmes manager and the director, with assistance from projects staff. \r\n\r\n",

IDA brings together over 1,100 organisations of persons with disabilities and their families from across eight global and six regional networks.\r\n\r\nTogether we promote the rights of persons with disabilities across the United Nations' efforts to advance human rights and sustainable development. We support organisations of persons with disabilities to hold their governments to account and advocate for change locally, nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of our work is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD). We promote the effective and full implementation of the UN CRPD, and compliance by governments and the UN System, through the active and coordinated involvement of representative organisations of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and international levels. The 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals are also integral to IDA's work to promote inclusive, sustainable development in line with the UN CRPD and the rights of persons with disabilities.\r\n\r\nWith member organisations around the world, IDA represents the estimated one billion people worldwide living with disabilities. This is the world’s largest – and most frequently overlooked – marginalised group. IDA, with its unique composition as a network of the foremost international disability rights organisations, is the most authoritative representation of persons with disabilities on the global level, and acknowledged as such by the United Nations system both in New York and Geneva.",

We have established a wide network of regional offices in turn connected to thousands of journalists, civil society organisations, government institutions, universities, media groups and regulatory bodies. Our programmes have ranged from rapid-response efforts to stabilise the media sector, to long-term programmes to embed increased citizen engagement, information access and key thematic strands into the regional information ecosystem. This deep-seated knowledge and expertise is further supported by strong relations around the world with influential reform agents within governments and the most senior/respected media stakeholders. Meanwhile, through the work of its London-based Technology hub, Internews Europe has successfully pioneered, developed and applied some of the most innovative information and communications technologies in support of its mission in the past few years. \r\n\r\n",

INPUD will expose and challenge stigma, discrimination, and the criminalisation of people who use drugs and its impact on the drug-using community’s health and rights. INPUD will achieve this through processes of empowerment and advocacy at the international level, while supporting empowerment and advocacy at community, national and regional levels.\r\n\r\nINPUD is a movement of people who use drugs (current and former) who support the Vancouver Declaration. The Vancouver Declaration sets out the demands of people who use drugs, emphasising that their human rights must be respected and their health and wellbeing prioritised. INPUD is a global network that seeks to represent people who use drugs in international agencies such as the United Nations and with those undertaking international development work. We believe that people who use drugs should be meaningfully represented in decision-making processes that affect our lives. INPUD is committed to demonstrating at country level how people who use drugs can constructively contribute to the development and delivery of services for our community. We believe that we have a unique insight that can help money be spent wisely thus delivering better results for individuals and the wider community. We are asking the international community to stop always framing us as the problem and instead to recognise that we are part of the solution when is comes to addressing problems associated with drugs and drug policy around the world.",

Our policy work focuses on several key themes that influence prospects for peace and security – the economy, climate change, gender, the role of international institutions, the impact of development aid, and the effect of good and bad governance.\r\n \r\nWe are one of the world’s leading peacebuilding NGOs with more than 200 staff based in London and 15 field offices.

			"publisher_description": "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is a membership Union uniquely composed of both government and civil society organisations. It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together.\r\n\r\nCreated in 1948, IUCN has evolved into the world’s largest and most diverse environmental network. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its 1,300 Member organisations and the input of some 16,000 experts. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. Our experts are organised into six commissions dedicated to species survival, environmental law, protected areas, social and economic policy, ecosystem management, and education and communication.\r\n\r\nThe ability to convene diverse stakeholders and provide the latest science, objective recommendations and on-the-ground expertise drives IUCN’s mission of informing and empowering conservation efforts worldwide. We provide a neutral forum in which governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples groups, faith-based organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges.\r\n\r\nBy facilitating these solutions, IUCN provides governments and institutions at all levels with the impetus to achieve universal goals, including on biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development, which IUCN was instrumental in defining.\r\n\r\nCombined, our knowledge base and diverse membership make IUCN an incubator and trusted repository of best practices, conservation tools, and international guidelines and standards. As the only environmental organisation with official United Nations Observer Status, IUCN ensures that nature conservation has a voice at the highest level of international governance.\r\n\r\nIUCN’s expertise and extensive network provide a solid foundation for a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects around the world. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people’s well-being. They also produce a wealth of data and information which feeds into IUCN’s analytical capacity.\r\n\r\nThrough their affiliation with IUCN, Member organisations are part of a democratic process, voting Resolutions which drive the global conservation agenda. They meet every four years at the IUCN World Conservation Congress to set priorities and agree on the Union’s work programme. IUCN congresses have produced several key international environmental agreements including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the World Heritage Convention, and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. We continue to help these conventions strengthen and evolve so that they can respond to emerging challenges.\r\n\r\nOur Member organisations are represented by the IUCN Council – the governing body. Headquartered in Switzerland, IUCN Secretariat comprises around 900 staff in more than 50 countries. ",

The below articles describe the principles which guide Mama Cash and its partners to make decisions to publish only parts of the information or to not publish any information of the activity. Mama Cash partners can include additional principles that apply only for their individual publication of data resulting of their activities undertaken.\r\n\r\nGeneral principles for exclusion\r\n1.1 External relations\r\nMama Cash will not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, local institutions, its partners, individuals or (back) donors. All stakeholders are informed upfront about the Mama Cash exclusion policy before publishing data. The stakeholders have a possibility to request exclusion, based on the principles in this exclusion policy which need to be followed up by Mama Cash. Mama Cash is, at all times, the final decision-maker for exclusion of data.\r\n1.2 Security and safety\r\nMama Cash will not publish data of which it can reasonably be expected that it might pose a risk to the physical or psycological safety or security of any individuals, members of staff, groups of beneficiaries, partner organizations, (back) donors or suppliers. \r\n1.3 Privacy\r\nMama Cash will not publish any activity information (photos, names, personal information) that is traceable to an individual person and can reasonably be judged as an invasion of the privacy of that person.\r\n1.4 Legal/Contractual\r\nMama Cash will not publish data if it does not have the right to publish the data or if contractual agreements with (back) donors or partner organisations impede Mama Cash’s right to publish the data.\r\n1.5 Social Impact\r\nMama Cash will not publish data that possibly harm the social impact of their partners in general and/or the activity undertaken by the partner.\r\n1.6 Operational damage\r\nMama Cash will not publish if sharing information on an activity (ties) could be disadvantageous to its success.\r\n1.7 Details\r\nMama Cash will not publish unnecessarily detailed information such as exact dates and locations. The level of detail that can be given depends on the type of activity. Activities which are generally considered safe can be published at the national level while very sensitive activities will be published at the regional level.\r\n1.8  Openness about the exclusion policy\r\nMama Cash will be transparent about the exclusion policy that it applies. This policy will therefore be published on its website. CMI! Consortium members will publish all excluded activities as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier and the total commitments for the activity.\r\n1.9  Data Quality\r\nMama Cash values the quality and consistency of their open data. Therefore Mama Cash will publish only activities data that meet the minimum requirements of secure and liable information. Data that do not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.\r\n2.0 Financal data\r\nMama Cash will publish financial data annually as the costs for publishing/obtaining the data are too high in relation to the relevance of the data for the public. \r\n",

				"about": "MAMTA is a leading national-level NGO which works across 18 states in the India and has extended its work in the region in Bangladesh and Nepal. MAMTA’s journey began in the urban slums of Tigri (New Delhi), in 1990 in the field of mother and child health and nutrition. After two decade, MAMTA has expanded into an established program implementation, advocacy, training and research institute, and acts as a think tank for national, state and local government and non-government organizations. It has demonstrated its wide expertise in health and development sector, with focus on maternal, newborn and child health, adolescent’s reproductive health and HIV / AIDS in gender and rights perspectives.\r\n\r\nMAMTA (mother’s love), as its name suggests is dedicated to the cause of mother and child. While working on child health and issues of low birth weight, it was realized that the pre pregnancy status of women was key to a lot of maternal and fetal outcomes. This resulted in MAMTA taking on the lead to work with unmarried and married adolescents/ youth in a gender sensitive and equitable manner.\r\n\r\nMAMTA is considerably experienced in managing and satisfying the requirements of externally-funded work to a high standard. MAMTA has been contracted for projects of significant value by several bilateral, multilateral and corporate philanthropic initiatives. Presently, MAMTA has the distinction of working with many UN agencies (UNIFEM, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO-CAH Geneva and SEARO) and bilateral and philanthropic agencies (Sida, British High Commission, Aus AID, McArthur Foundation and International HIV/AIDS Alliance), distinguished corporate ( Sir Jamshetji TATA Trust, ASAI Glasses, Phillips, Green Ply, Unicharm, DLF, Glenmark, Angelique International and Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, Inc, USA) that collectively demonstrating confidence in MAMTA’s capacity to manage for quality outcomes.

We are focused on doing this in a sustainable way in line with the UN SDGs.\r\n\r\nA world of equal opportunity where everyone has access to education, healthcare and a living wage and where everyone is afforded respect regardless of their gender, age, religion, race, caste and physical capability\r\n\r\nIt is my vision, where everyone relishes his/her rights to live.\r\n- My vision is based on 'strengthening families at grassroots. For this, I look at women and the young the source of 'change'. \r\nEmpower the earning capabilities of women. When a woman starts earning, her family sees a bright future; \r\n- children are sent to school- impact on child labour, child marriage, school dropouts, child trafficking etc; \r\n- she cares her family - malnutrition is eradicated; \r\n- when she earns, she cares the elders, \r\n- she cares her own health and \r\n- she get the power to decide her reproductive rights - no more child bearing machines. \r\n\r\nAnd empower the young with same skills training- they represent the immediate next generation.\r\nWhen families are economically strengthened, each family is capable of caring their own. \r\n\r\nWe have a new concept of Sustainable Chain Impact (SCI). Something civil societies have failed for generations to think. What we mean by SCI?\r\nA beneficiary becoming a benefactor to another beneficiary. How?\r\n\r\nWhen we educate a child - the child has to educate another poor child when he/she is capable of earning. \r\nWhen we train a woman/youth or any, in any skill training, should train another in their neighbourhood. \r\nWhen we provide agriculture insights/use of new methods in a village, the people in the village are divided into smaller groups of two or three and are sent to nearby villages to train the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWE DON'T WANT TO GENERATE SOCIAL SELFISH PEOPLE IN OUR PROJECTS. \r\nEveryone beneficiary of any of the project we implement, should become a benefactor to another. FREELY GIVEN and therefore FREELY SHARED.\r\n\r\nEvery grant invested in our projects will be multiplied to bear much much fruits. \r\nAs a grassroots organisation all our projects have their foundation in the community in which they are being run. We believe this ‘community-centric’ approach is the only way of ensuring that the projects are truly successful and that the resulting benefits are both long-term and sustainable. Local people are empowered to take ownership of the projects in their communities, giving them a stake in the outcomes and encouraging an ongoing embedded commitment to development.",

			"publisher_description": "NewBeginnings – to give hope to those who feel ‘is lost’; who feel it is their ‘fate’ and nothing can be done; to those who are convinced of themselves to pull along with the burden, cursing being born as a human being.\r\nNewBeginnings stands with a new hope. When Dr. Saraswathi Iyer, HoD of Acharya Nagarjuna University joined in one of our Youth Leaders’ Capacity Building, she said, “NewBeginnings is really a New Beginning for the marginalised”\r\nNCT became a registered ngo on 23rd Nov, 2009. It all started when three of the founding members who have long years of professional experience in social works decided to have a ngo that thinks differently and is bold enough to stand with those who are vulnerable. We deliberately choose target groups who are ignored, live in utter poverty for generations; We choose areas where others don’t usually go. We don’t expect sustainability in our projects. We aim at Chain of Sustainable Impact in our projects. What we mean by CSI – the beneficiary of a project should become a benefactor to her/his own neighbour. A trained youth of our project should train another youth in the same vocational skill; a child who is sponsored right now for her education should promise that she would educate another poor child when she is able to earn; a women group which has been trained in how to counsel and avoid domestic violence should talk to women in their neighbourhoods. Thus, we multiply the grant we receive from our donors. \r\nAt the heart of our mission is transparency. A well-organized Management Structure headed by the Governing Body and is well connected to the stakeholders of our programmes.\r\nNewBeginnings has a clearly written down policies and System in place. Be sure, you will be working with a professionally managed organisation: A clearly written down Management policies, Staff polices, Finance Polices, Volunteers’ Policies and Networking Policies etc guide us in our daily work.\r\nWhere there is no hope, we begin to give hope; where people feel that they have come to a dead-end, we want to start again. NewBeginnings gives a New Beginning in every heart; show them a way to live. Life it to the full.  ",

NIS works in environments where many other agencies are unwilling or unable to operate, and has further established a field office in Mogadishu, Somalia. NIS’s work can be subdivided in the following three categories:  field-based interventions working with government to deliver short-term prioritised services and infrastructure; advising central and regional authorities on capacity-building to support the government bodies in portraying political will to change and stabilisation, and; analytical work based on long-term field presence and extensive networks.

			"publisher_record_exclusions": "1. Introduction\r\nPAX values transparency and accountability. Therefore PAX decided to publish its project data. PAX commits itself to publish its project data set compliant to the IATI standard. The first IATI compliant project data set will be published at no later than 30-04-2016. The projects that ran in the period 01-01-2016 and 30-03-2016 will be included in the data set. PAX embraces the principle “Open, unless…”. This means that PAX remains to have the right to exclude project information from publication to IATI if it falls in one of the following categories:\r\n•\tInformation disclosure affecting relations between partner organization and government/other NGOs (human rights work or work in some conflict affected states);\r\n•\tDetailed specific information affecting and jeopardizing the safety and security of NGO staff, partner staff or beneficiaries;\r\n•\tPersonal information of individual staff and/or partners (e.g. addresses and telephone numbers);\r\n•\tCommercially sensitive information (salaries, consultant fees);\r\n•\tInformation that is exempt under data protection laws or by pre-existing organizational policies.\r\n2. Articles\r\n2.1 General principles for exclusion\r\nExternal relations\r\nPAX does not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, authorities  or institutions of PAX, its partners or other donors. All partner organizations and donors\r\nare informed on forehand about PAX’s policies concerning publishing project data . All the parties have the possibility to request exclusion on forehand, based on the principles in this exclusion policy. PAX is, at all times, the final decision-maker for the exclusion of data.\r\nSecurity\r\nPAX does not publish data of which it can be expected that it might pose a risk to\r\nthe safety and/or security of any individuals, local PAX offices, groups of beneficiaries, partner\r\norganizations, donors or suppliers. From a security point of view it was decided to\r\npublish transaction on a cumulative basis per quarter per activity.\r\nPrivacy\r\nPAX does not publish any information which is traceable to an individual person and that violates that person’s privacy without obtaining prior consent of that specific person involved.\r\nCommercial/Strategic\r\nPAX does not publish data that might harm the commercial or strategic interests of PAX,\r\nits partners, donors or suppliers. Information about the conditions and repayments of loans, investments and guarantees is part of this exclusion and will therefore not be published by PAX.\r\nLegal/Contractual\r\nPAX does not publish data if we do not have the right to publish the data. PAX will not publish the data if PAX does not hold the copyright on particular information or if contractual agreements with back donors or partner organizations impede PAX’s right to publish the data.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nPAX publishes all project data of projects started after 01-01-2016  or ongoing projects\r\nwith new commitments of more than EUR 25,000 in 2016. \r\nSocial impact\r\nPAX does not publish data that possibly harms the social impact of PAX in general or the related project in particular.\r\nOpenness and transparency about the exclusion policy\r\nPAX is transparent about the exclusion policy that PAX applies to its published IATI compliant data set. This policy is therefore published on the publicly accessible website of PAX: www.paxvoorvrede.nl.\r\nPublished activities \r\nPAX will report all its projects as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier. However, other information might not be included if one or more categories that are mentioned in this exclusion policy apply. \r\nData Quality\r\nPAX values the quality and consistency of its open data. Therefore PAX publishes only\r\nproject data that meet the minimum requirements. The data quality concerning e.g. reliability will be assessed by program officers. Data that does not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.\r\n3. Decision-making on excluding data\r\nPAX has the right to exclude data. Information will be disclosed unless a project officer decides otherwise. The responsibility for excluding information is at the level where the information can be assessed in detail. It is possible to exclude a particular project, specific information fields of the IATI standard and/or specific documents from disclosure in the project administration. \r\n4. Review of exclusion policy and quality of data\r\nOn a quarterly basis the planning, monitoring and evaluation department of PAX will review all data excluded from disclosure. It will be reviewed whether data are rightly excluded and if the exclusion policy is still valid. The exclusion policy will be reviewed and if necessary adjusted on an annual basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If the private sector is to be attracted to invest in infrastructure projects in these countries, it will need expert and reliable encouragement and support.\r\n\r\nThrough a group of subsidiary companies (the PIDG Facilities), PIDG offers specialised financing and project development expertise. Each Facility can customise the right solution for each set of circumstances. Together, these companies are designed to get infrastructure initiatives off the ground, in countries which find investment hard to attract.",

We believe that working with men and boys to transform harmful gender norms and unequal power dynamics is a critical part of the solution to achieve gender equality. For the empowerment of women and girls to continue advancing, men and boys must see themselves as allies in the process. Men and boys also benefit when harmful norms are challenged. Our research, programs, and advocacy efforts show that promoting healthy masculinity (or positive notions of “what it means to be a man”) and femininity (or “what is means to be a woman”) leads to improvements in men’s own lives, and in the lives of women and girls.",

Attention for the community in which children grow up is essential to do justice to all of these aspects. We encourage communities to participate and contribute to the content of our programs.\r\nOut of principle Red een Kind chooses to work with local partner organisations that have their roots in the area. In our view local organisation are the key to good relationships with the local community.

In our internal systems, multi-country grants and contracts are set up as internal ‘funding streams’ with ‘child’ awards for each country. We do this in order to facilitate financial reconciliations between country offices. Due to the way information is held within our systems, ‘parent’ funding streams and their child awards are all published as separate IATI activities, with their relationship indicated using IATI’s ‘related activity’ elements. The parent funding stream IATI activity will not have certain fields/elements (description, sector, recipient-country/region, document-link and records of expenditure). These are published on the child award’s IATI activity file only. In addition, incoming funds may only be recorded against the parent activity (the initial way our systems were set up). In late 2016 we introduced recording of income against the child activity as well (to be phased in across live and new awards). \r\n\r\nOur systems do not easily map against the IATI categories for completion / post-completion, therefore we have adopted ‘implementation’ to cover all award activity (e.g. programme activity may have ended but financial reconciliation, etc. is still ongoing). Therefore in some instances an award status may display as ‘implementation’ even after its planned end date.",

As it is taken directly and unaudited, it offers the highest possible level of transparency on our activities.\r\n\r\nIt is important to publish timely data reflective of the fast-changing nature of Save the Children’s programmes.  This does, however, mean it may differ from the high-quality, audited information that we share through our Annual Report.  For example, our exclusions policy means that the financial information found in our IATI data and Annual Report will not correspond, and for a comprehensive overview the latter document remains the most appropriate source – it is available at: www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us\r\n"

Solidaridad works across 13 supply chains and operates through 9 regional offices on 5 continents.\r\n\r\nEnsuring quality of life and a healthy planet for all of us requires continuous effort and mutual cooperation from all parties involved. It also means creating products and processes along supply chains that will help us transition towards a fully inclusive, sustainable economy.\r\n\r\nThere are many values, interests and agendas at play in this transition. And sometimes they conflict. Yet our experience has shown that by connecting, partnering and collaborating with all players, it is possible to reconcile social and ecological responsibilities with supply chain and market realities.\r\n\r\nTo do that, Solidaridad pioneers innovative certification schemes, establishes producer education programmes, supports good business practices, shapes national and international policy, creates new market linkages, builds knowledge-based commodity solutions and more.\r\n\r\nInvesting in structural change – like safeguarding food security, strengthening acceptable labour conditions and a living wage, creating infrastructures for responsible mining, and facilitating access to investment – is the only way to sustain positive impact on the health and livelihoods of people and the planet not just for today, but well into the future.",

The Foundation’s vision is to “improve the lives of disadvantaged children and their communities globally”. This aspiration is realised through a range of initiatives designed to tackle development challenges in some of the poorest countries in the world.  Through a range of approaches, Stars aims to support local actors to address problems they identify by providing access to funding and non-financial support. \r\nStars believes that well-run local organisations are best placed to respond to the needs of their communities and the young people in their care. All too often however, they are constrained by a rigid approach to partnerships and funding which can limit their effectiveness. \r\nStars’ flagship activity is the annual ‘Impact Awards’ which recognise and reward effective and well-managed local organisations working in the fields of child health, education, protection and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene). Stars aims to select a winner and runner-up in each field across three regions: Africa-Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America-the Caribbean. The Awards are open to applications from the 100 countries with the highest rates of under-five mortality (http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/apply/eligibility-2/). ",

Founded in Paris in 1920, the core strengths of the organization are in technical assistance, operational research and education, addressing the challenges of tuberculosis (TB), lung disease, HIV/AIDS and tobacco control in low and middle-income countries. The Union offers technical assistance; provides education and training opportunities, including international and regional conferences; and supports operational research and other research and publications. The Union also raises awareness about health issues. The Union works in approximately 80 countries every year and is both an international scientific institute, with 11 offices worldwide, and a federation of some 3,400 individual and organizational members in 150 countries. The Union maintains relationships with the World Health Organization, the United Nations, and other nongovernmental institutions in the health and development sectors",

In 2010 CSD contracted, through a competitive tendering process, a Fund Manager to manage the competition process for new grants and the day to day management of selected projects.  The contract was awarded to a Joint Venture between Triple Line Consulting and Crown Agents.  The GPAF and CSCF are managed between DFID and TLC/CA as follows.  DFID sets the strategic direction for the CSCF and the GPAF.  This includes aligning the overarching objectives of the funds to DFID’s Business Plan, agreeing the design of the competition and the funding mechanism and taking final decisions on grant selection.  The Fund Manager runs the funding competition process, including providing support to applicants and undertaking eligibility and initial quality assessments of applications against a criteria agreed with DFID.  Once DFID has selected projects for funding, the Fund Manager provides support to grant holders to put in place robust monitoring and evaluation systems, clear and justified budgets and project plans.  The Fund Manager then oversees the projects for the life of the grant, disbursing funding, monitoring financial and technical performance to ensure projects meet the set standard, and ensuring that any additional grant conditions are met.  The Fund Manager also leads on learning across the Funds to help the sector better understand what works, what doesn’t and why across the objectives supported by the Funds.  ",

It has also established long-term development programmes in these regions and others affected by poverty, inequality and human rights violations. \r\nToday Trócaire works in over 20 countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. In Ireland, we raise awareness about the causes of poverty through our outreach programmes in the education sector, through parish networks, and through our public campaigns and advocacy work.",

The guidance does provide the following principled exceptions:\r\n\r\na) When public disclosure threatens national security interests; b) When public disclosure is likely to jeopardize the personal safety of U.S. personnel or recipients of U.S. resources; c) When public disclosure would interfere with the agency's ability to effectively discharge its ongoing responsibilities in foreign assistance activities; d) When there are legal constraints on the disclosure of business or proprietary information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; e) When the laws or regulations of a recipient country apply to a bilateral agreement and restrict access to information; or f) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nWhen examining information that falls within these categories, USG agencies have sufficient flexibility to protect sensitive information from disclosure, on a case-by-case basis, in order to protect against potential harm while maintaining a strong presumption in favor of transparency. To ensure that these exceptions are rarely applied, and are used appropriately and consistent with the presumption of openness, agencies will maintain specific case-by-case justifications for all instances of reliance on the principled exceptions established in this section. \r\n",

As part of its overall data quality control and assurance processes, the U.S. Government will work to identify and resolve discrepancies between preliminary and verified data.  This iterative process will likely result in the publishing of better quality data on a quarterly basis over time.\r\n*Roughly 20% of the records in the CRS generated files have incorrect U.S. Government extending agency names and / or codes.

The guidance does provide the following principled exceptions: a) When public disclosure threatens national security interests; b) When public disclosure is likely to jeopardize the personal safety of U.S. personnel or recipients of U.S. resources; c) When public disclosure would interfere with the agency's ability to effectively discharge its ongoing responsibilities in foreign assistance activities; d) When there are legal constraints on the disclosure of business or proprietary information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; e) When the laws or regulations of a recipient country apply to a bilateral agreement and restrict access to information; or f) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations. When examining information that falls within these categories, USG agencies have sufficient flexibility to protect sensitive information from disclosure, on a case-by-case basis, in order to protect against potential harm while maintaining a strong presumption in favor of transparency. To ensure that these exceptions are rarely applied, and are used appropriately and consistent with the presumption of openness, agencies will maintain specific case-by-case justifications for all instances of reliance on the principled exceptions established in this section.",

			"publisher_description": "Vrutti is a Centre for sustainable livelihoods enhancing people’s well-being.  We are enablers of ecosystem solutions that are transformative to end poverty, marginalisation and create wealth for small-producers and marginalised communities in India and developing nations.   We achieve this through innovation, knowledge and transformative actions, while engaging across grass-root to policy levels. \r\n\r\nWe are here as there are number of societal problems, such as poverty and inequity, marginalisation and vulnerability to diseases, disasters, etc., low capabilities and lack of voice of people, and lack of services and opportunities; and these continue to grow.  Solutions exist, but are usually isolated, verticalised and hardly converge to create impact or reach scale.  We, as social entrepreneurs, try our best to facilitate solutions, rather than leaving it to the Government or to the people themselves. \r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that ‘Sustainable Livelihood Approach’ can be a great lever to address poverty, marginalisation and inclusive development.  It is very important that these approaches are customised to address different forms of marginalisation, people’s needs, aspirations and the local context.  All our design and work starts with ‘People-First and People at the Centre‘– empathy-led designs distinct from technical/ scientific designs.  \r\n\r\nTo us, scale is about reach and impact at the community… how depth and width that we have contributed to and for how long these benefits sustain.   Our solutions should therefore be modelled to take us to the scale. We don’t get satisfied with doing it at a few places or with few people.  We therefore ‘model’ our approaches, ‘cost’ them, and ‘integrate’ them to be adopted by communities or market or public policy.\r\n\r\nWe are passionate about measurement, critiquing ourselves and improve.  We work through result-based planning tools, performance measurement metrics, impact and value for money assessments and use technology where feasible. \r\n\r\nWe current reach out to about 310,000 families, which includes farming households, communities that are vulnerable to HIV, communities that are affected with limited access to drinking water, sanitation and disaster affected.   We work through Four Models of livelihood transformation, which are built on different development approaches for different profiles of people - entitlement-focused models to market based models, and hybrid models. \r\n\r\nWe work across seven states in India, and work through about 162 community based organisations (such as producer companies/ cooperatives, federations of marginalised groups, etc.)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.vrutti.org",

Children and young people are creative and have the skills to shape their lives and cope with adversity, even when they have experienced armed conflict. In War Child Holland’s projects, children and young people use creativity as a tool to cope with the effects of armed conflict. Creative activities generate positive energy, give children and young people new skills that they can be proud of and provide instant fun. They learn to overcome their fears, develop confidence, and find a way to deal with their experiences. Through active participation in our projects, children and young people, including the most vulnerable, are able to express their views freely and have a say in decision-making. As a conflict-sensitive organisation, War Child Holland ensures its actions and projects do not negatively influence a conflict.",

A world in which the conditions for a healthy life are present and in which everyone has equal access to healthcare. A world in which governments fulfil their obligation to respect, protect and realize the right to health. This is the vision that inspires our mission.\r\nWemos influences (inter)national policy in such a way that the right to health is respected, protected and promoted. Wemos contributes to policy changes aimed at making structural improvements in health for all. We advocate for ethical conduct, coherent and fair policy and health equity by appplying a global perspective on health.\r\nWemos’ objective is to draw the government’s attention to its obligation to respect, protect and realize the right to health. Taking our themes as the basis, we present practical proposals for policy improvements which will advance the health situation worldwide. Where necessary, Wemos also addresses other parties, such as companies and international institutions.\r\nThe right to health is expressly included in various charters and treaties, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This means that the necessary conditions for a healthy and productive life, such as affordable care and good nutrition, should be available worldwide.",

Windle continues to implement education interventions in both Kakuma and Dadaab refugee complexes as well as the immediate host communities. The overall impact of these interventions has been improved life chances and economic and social well-being of marginalized girls and boys.",
