Our primary accountability is to people living in poverty and injustice, but we also balance our accountabilities to donors, supporters, staff and other stakeholders.    ActionAid UK’s income comes from a variety of sources including from our 135,000 individual supporters, trusts and foundations, and institutions like DfID, and the EU. Ongoing regular donations from the public represent a particularly critical element of our funding mix - both in terms of proportion of our global income, but also in terms of its potential for both transformational and focused change.  We use our funding mix holistically to deliver results in the communities in which we work.  In addition, we use unrestricted income for activities which support the International Secretariat which supports 46 countries across the ActionAid Federation. \r\n\r\nIn 2013 we raised £63.7 million, seeing a seven per cent increase in our income.  For every £10 of the money we raised, £7.54 was spent on our charitable activity – £7.00 on our activities overseas and 54 pence in the UK on education outreach to schools and on campaigning. Of the remainder, £1.85 was spent on fundraising and 61 pence on UK support costs. \r\n\r\n \r\nActionAid UK’s data that’s published to the IATI registry is summarised under the six categories above as this corresponds directly with our Trustee Report & Accounts for 2013 (and is therefore based on audited data): \r\n\r\nhttp://www.actionaid.org.uk/about-us/trustees-report-and-accounts.  \r\n\r\nAs we align our IATI reporting with our Trustee Report & Accounts, the bulk of our reporting to IATI is annual.

Please contact transparency@actionaid.org if you have any comments or queries.\r\n\r\nAs our income comes from hundreds of thousands of individual people, community groups, trusts and foundations, we have not published their names as we do not have their permission to disclose their identity and details.  We therefore have anonymised the data published to the IATI registry where that’s appropriate.  Naturally we have disclosed information relating to official income from organisations such as DfID, EU, ECHO, Comic Relief, and Big Lottery.\r\n\r\nOur income from private individuals (committed giving) involves regular ongoing cash or direct debit payments and a large proportion of our loyal supporter base stay with us for many years.  However, the IATI data format requires to enter start and end dates.  Given that it is not easy to represent an ongoing income stream in IATI (and after having taken advice from IATI on how best to do this), we have stated start and end dates of 1st January and 31st December against all committed giving.\r\n"

				"about": "A Brief Introduction to BASE\r\n\r\nBASE – Our History\r\n\r\nThe origins of Backward Society Education (BASE) are to be found in a pioneering group of young activists who established the Charpate Club in January 1985.  It was during their traditional Tharu New Year meeting in the village of Dumrigaon in Dang that the thirty four young people, including our founder Dill Bahadur Chaudhary, gathered together to discuss the problem of kamaiya bonded labor.  After raising 700 rupees through cultural shows, the Charpate Club went on to become BASE in 1990, and to lead the fight against the exploitative kamaiya system which was finally abolished on 17 July 2000.  After this monumental event BASE continued to work for the education and rehabilitation of the freed-kamaiyas, as well as people from other marginalized communities.  BASE has received international recognition for its work, and Dilli Chaudhary has won many awards including the 1994 Reebok Human Rights Award and the 2002 Anti Slavery Award. sought \r\n\r\nBASE – The NGO\r\n\r\nBASE continues in its commitment to fight against illiteracy, poverty and social and political discrimination amongst all marginalized communities.  Our aim is to transform the outlook of downtrodden people as well as their oppressors.  We currently operate in eight districts in the mid and far western regions of Nepal, those being Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali, Kanchanpur, Salyan, Surkhet and Rukum.  However, we are now considering expanding our projects into other districts.  Our main areas of work include formal and non-formal education, ensuring and sustaining rights for freed-kamaiyas, livelihood support, child labor elimination, support for sustainable democracy, human rights violation monitoring, conflict mitigation, water and sanitation, environmental sustainability, disaster preparedness and response, infrastructure support, the protection and promotion of traditional and indigenous cultures, and support for children associated with armed groups.  BASE hires its staff primarily from the local communities of indigenous and marginalized people it serves, and in doing so it works to strengthen indigenous capabilities. Advance\r\n\r\nBASE – The Social Movement\r\n\r\nBASE is not just an NGO but one of the largest social movements in South Asia.  We have a membership of over 200,000 people, of which about 29,000 are actively engaged in voluntary community work.  BASE’s membership is organized through a network of district committees, area committees, village committees, women’s awareness committees and youth awareness committees, all operating at their own respective level and in their own areas.  These grassroots committee members are democratically elected every five years, and they provide the strategies and ideas to keep BASE in touch with the current needs of our communities.  The committees also play a crucial role in monitoring and evaluation, troubleshooting, coordinating with national and international agencies, and communication and exposure of BASE in the diplomatic sphere.  The power of BASE’s membership is even further enhanced by hundreds of child clubs, women’s groups, income generation groups and other community organizations.\r\n\r\nBackward Society Education (BASE), Tulsipur Municipality-6, Dang, Rapti Zone, Nepal \r\nT +977 82 520055, 82 520312 F +977 82 522212 E info@nepalbase.org W www.nepalbase.org\r\n\r\n",

Five years after the struggle, the bonded labor system was officially abolished in Nepal following the government committed to rehabilitate and provide them compensation in terms of land, creation of employment opportunity and education for their children. This was a huge achievements for the ex bonded labour who were deprived of their rights and entitlements under various alibis for ages. Unfortunately, the lack of effective implementation of the commitment has remained a major challenge and as a result the great majority of ex bonded labour continue to suffer with no sign of relenting. Hence, the project jointly has implemented by the BASE as lead applicant and WVAF as partner organization have envisioned ameliorating the situation that has remained a long overdue. Moreover, the project will also contribute in achieving some of the goals of MDG by addressing the problem of ex-Kamaiya related with child labour and unemployment/underemployment through livelihood support, education, holding duty bearers to account and capacity building of Kamaiya leaders. It is implemented in five districts of Nepal.",

			"publisher_description": "The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is one of the fastest and most effective ways to support rapid humanitarian response for people affected by natural disasters and armed conflict. CERF receives voluntary contributions year-round to provide immediate funding for life-saving humanitarian action anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nERF pools contributions from donors – mainly governments, but also, foundations, companies, charities and individuals – into a single fund with a $450 million annual target.\r\n\r\nThis money is set aside for immediate use at the onset of emergencies, in rapidly deteriorating situations and in protracted crises that fail to attract sufficient resources.\r\n\r\nIn emergencies, humanitarian organizations apply jointly for funding. Funds are immediately released if these proposals meet CERF’s criteria, i.e. the needs are urgent and the proposed activities will save lives.\r\n\r\nWith money available immediately, relief organizations can deliver food, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other life-saving aid faster and more efficiently.\r\n\r\nCERF allocations are designed to complement other humanitarian funding sources, such as country-based pooled funds and bilateral funding.\r\n\r\nCERF makes money available when it is needed most: at the beginning of a crisis, when time is of the essence and it is critical that emergency relief operations get under way quickly.\r\n\r\nBut mobilizing funds can take time and as time passes, more lives are lost.\r\nCERF helps to remedy this problem with rapid response grants, which can be approved in as little as 48 hours.\r\n\r\nCERF provides funding to the world’s most neglected crises. When a disaster fades from the headlines, or never makes the headlines, it is much harder to raise funds. The need for help, however, is no less significant.\r\n\r\nCERF helps to address this challenge with underfunded emergencies grants, which are disbursed twice a year for emergencies that have not attracted sufficient funding.\r\n\r\nCERF has a loan facility of $30 million. Up to one-year loans are provided based on indication that donor funding is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIn an average year, CERF allocates approximately $450 million to humanitarian operations in some 50 different countries. Since 2006, more than $3.7 billion has been allocated to help millions of people in 92 countries and territories across the world.\r\n\r\nCERF funding is available to UN agencies, funds and programmes and the International Organization for Migration.\r\n\r\nNGOs are important partners in the CERF allocation decision making processes and receive CERF funding when they carry out work for recipient organizations.\r\n\r\nCERF is funded by voluntary contributions. Since 2006, CERF has received almost $3.8 billion from 125 UN Member States and observers, regional and local authorities, and other public and private donors. A third of CERF’s contributors have also received support from the fund.\r\n\r\nThe Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) manages CERF on behalf of the UN Secretary-General.\r\n\r\nThe ERC is supported by the CERF secretariat, which is situated within the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe CERF secretariat is responsible for ensuring that the funds are allocated properly, disbursed in a timely manner, and that use of the funds is reported appropriately and transparently.\r\n\r\nThe CERF Advisory Group provides policy guidance to the Secretary-General on the use and impact of the fund.",

Identifying that food is the best medicine, they believed that developing small-scale agriculture is the key to reducing rural poverty. In 1987, Farm Africa started work with nomadic pastoralists in the remote north of Kenya, expanding to Ethiopia a year later.  \r\n\r\nFarm Africa believes that Africa has the power to feed itself and that its smallholders hold the key to lasting rural prosperity. We work directly with farmers to help them unleash their potential to feed Africa’s people.  We pioneer techniques that boost harvests, reduce poverty, sustain natural resources and help end Africa’s need for aid.  \r\n\r\nFarm Africa has 200 staff operating across the east African countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.  Farm Africa’s local staff provide the tools and expertise to enable smallholders in eastern Africa to increase their harvests, whether they farm crops, livestock, fish or the forest.  We train them to be more commercial, adding value to surpluses by milling, drying, or turning their produce into products that fetch a higher price.  With better food for their families and reliable incomes from their businesses, farmers can build for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

			"publisher_record_exclusions": "Free a Girl Exclusion Policy for IATI\r\n\r\nIn line with principles of transparency and accountability, Free a girl commits to publishing project data on IATI as of January 2016. More information about IATI and its objectives is available on the IATI website.\r\n\r\nFree a Girl is first focusing on publishing data on projects receiving funding from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Data from projects with other funding sources and donors are therefore excluded from publication at this stage.  \r\n\r\nFree a Girl adheres to the principle of ‘Open, unless…’, whereby data on project activities are excluded from publication on IATI if the information falls under one of the following categories: \r\n\r\n1.\tProjects that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Netherlands\r\nFree a Girl publishes all projects funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Other projects and programmes are not published in the beginning. This policy will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. \r\n2.\tSafety and security \r\nIf the information disclosed could reasonably pose a threat to the safety and security of any individuals, such as project beneficiaries, partner organisations, Free a Girl staff or donors, it is excluded. This could include but is not limited to, specific locations of project activities and addresses of local partner offices and so forth. \r\n3.\tHarmful for project activities \r\nInformation that would cause harm or jeopardise the implementation or success of project activities is not disclosed. Given the work of Free a Girl in the area of commercial sexual exploitation, this could include information, for example, about targets of future rescue raid operations or advocacy activities.  \r\n4.\tExternal relations\r\nFree a girl does not publish information that may negatively affect relationships with partner organisations, donors and other key stakeholders. Partner organisations and back donors related to projects that are published on IATI are informed of Free a Girl’s policies for publishing project data and can request exclusion. \r\n\r\n5.\tConfidentiality and privacy\r\nInformation that can be traced to an individual, constitutes an invasion of privacy, or may be confidential due to legal, commercial or contractual reasons, is not disclosed. \r\n6.\tCost-effectiveness \r\nFree a Girl does not publish data where the time or monetary costs of obtaining and publishing the data outweigh the expected social impact or public benefit. \r\n7.\tHistory\r\nFree a Girl publishes data from projects funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that commenced after 30 June 2015. Projects prior to this date and that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are excluded at this stage. \r\n\r\nReviews and decision-making \r\nA review of this exclusion policy is conducted on a quarterly basis by the programmes manager and staff, in order to keep abreast of new requirements and changes in internal policies. Decision-making regarding publication of data and exclusions is done by the programmes manager and the director, with assistance from projects staff. \r\n\r\n",

Good governance provides the basis for efficient markets and effective government service delivery; it also plays a powerful role in reaffirming citizens’ belief in democracy as a just means of organizing public life. We seek a public sector that is responsive and accountable rather than predatory, capable of promoting economic growth through citizen empowerment while simultaneously addressing complex public policy challenges.  We are inspired by reformers – whether in government, civil society, or the private sector – who work towards the same ideals. Our approach is to collaborate with them whenever possible.\r\n\r\nGlobal Integrity is an innovation lab that produces high-quality research and creates cutting-edge technology to advance the work of a global network of civic, public, and private reformers pursuing increased transparency and accountability in governments.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our core team, we collaborate with a global network of more than 1,300 in-country contributors and partners who take our technologies, tools, and information to where they are most useful – the local level. \r\n\r\n",

Supply chain management of health commodities is an essential prerequisite of a functioning health system. Healthy Entrepreneurs is actively involved in all elements of the supply chain in order to guarantee availability of high quality products at customer level. We work in five countries with our own wholesale operation, implementing partners (country offices or partner organizations) and our entrepreneurs.\r\nBy the end of this year, 900 entrepreneurs will be active in Burundi, DRC, Rwanda, Uganda and Haiti.

His work with SFCT saw him researching a wide array of issues from the environment and international trade to health inequalities and youth work. Already familiar with Indigo’s profile and portfolio, Matt is excited to be working in ICT4D and looks forward to extending his knowledge of the field over the weeks and months ahead.\r\n\r\nSince graduating from the University of Bristol with a First Class BA (Hons) in Modern Languages, Matt has worked as a translator and film and television subtitler in Berlin and completed an MPhil on minority groups in the early German Democratic Republic. His academic background has provided him with a sound set of research skills, while his time at the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts has given him a solid grounding in philanthropy and the third sector.",

MAMTA has been contracted for projects of significant value by several bilateral, multilateral and corporate philanthropic initiatives. Presently, MAMTA has the distinction of working with many UN agencies (UNIFEM, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO-CAH Geneva and SEARO) and bilateral and philanthropic agencies (Sida, British High Commission, Aus AID, McArthur Foundation and International HIV/AIDS Alliance), distinguished corporate ( Sir Jamshetji TATA Trust, ASAI Glasses, Phillips, Green Ply, Unicharm, DLF, Glenmark, Angelique International and Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, Inc, USA) that collectively demonstrating confidence in MAMTA’s capacity to manage for quality outcomes.

We do this by strengthening the programmatic and organizational capacity of the parties.

These programmes focus on democratic values, knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\nIn general, politicians are much more interested in learning from fellow politicians than from project managers and consultants.

If the private sector is to be attracted to invest in infrastructure projects in these countries, it will need expert and reliable encouragement and support.\r\n\r\nThrough a group of subsidiary companies (the PIDG Facilities), PIDG offers specialised financing and project development expertise.

That is our deeply rooted conviction. We approach the child as a valuable human being, with spiritual, mental, emotional, cognitive, social, physical and economic aspects. Attention for the community in which children grow up is essential to do justice to all of these aspects. We encourage communities to participate and contribute to the content of our programs.\r\nOut of principle Red een Kind chooses to work with local partner organisations that have their roots in the area. In our view local organisation are the key to good relationships with the local community. We devote much time and attention to equipping and coaching our partners in order to bring about effective change. Our strategy is set out in a ‘Theory of Change’.",

This means that some fields may be excluded on some activities. \r\n\r\nAs a rights-based organisation we have a commitment to safeguard children, especially those with whom we are in contact.  Therefore we will not publish any information that could identify an individual child.  More information can be found in our Child Safeguarding Policy.  \r\n\r\nWe may also exclude any politically or culturally sensitive information that may hinder our ability to operate in certain locations, or data that we cannot share for privacy, confidentiality, or wider regulatory or statutory reasons. \r\nSave the Children is also funded by corporate partners, community groups, and individual supporters.  Our Open Information Policy contains detailed guidance on how you can access information on these sources, and on why it may sometimes be impossible for us to share this for security, privacy, or confidentiality reasons.\r\n",

This does, however, mean it may differ from the high-quality, audited information that we share through our Annual Report.  For example, our exclusions policy means that the financial information found in our IATI data and Annual Report will not correspond, and for a comprehensive overview the latter document remains the most appropriate source – it is available at: www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us\r\n"

Through a range of approaches, Stars aims to support local actors to address problems they identify by providing access to funding and non-financial support. \r\nStars believes that well-run local organisations are best placed to respond to the needs of their communities and the young people in their care. All too often however, they are constrained by a rigid approach to partnerships and funding which can limit their effectiveness. \r\nStars’ flagship activity is the annual ‘Impact Awards’ which recognise and reward effective and well-managed local organisations working in the fields of child health, education, protection and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene). Stars aims to select a winner and runner-up in each field across three regions: Africa-Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America-the Caribbean.

It was set up by people who felt that with its long tradition of TB work, there should be a greater response in Britain to the resurgent threat of tuberculosis - already declared a global emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1993.\r\n\r\nTB Alert is the first TB-specific charity in Britain since the 1960s when earlier organisations, assuming too soon that the disease had been vanquished, faded away or moved on to other interests. Its active Trustees include many of the leading experts on TB based in Britain.",

In the Global Fund context, performance is therefore recognised as a predictor of future disbursements and acknowledged as an important variable in predictable financing. This issue particularly pertains to annual budgets, which are adjusted according to country performance and planned disbursements, which are calculated on the basis of past performance and expected results, and are adjusted on the basis of a transparent assessment of results against time-bound targets.\r\n\r\nMoreover, data found in the Data Catalog is unit-level data based on Global Fund grant information.  Data at the grant level may not be aggregated to obtain higher-level data (i.e. country or regional levels).  Aggregation of data will in some cases result in double counting and produce inaccurate figures.  In order to obtain accurate higher-level data about Global Fund activities, please refer to figures published by the Global Fund at http://portfolio.theglobalfund.org/?lang=en.\r\n",

In 2010 CSD contracted, through a competitive tendering process, a Fund Manager to manage the competition process for new grants and the day to day management of selected projects.  The contract was awarded to a Joint Venture between Triple Line Consulting and Crown Agents.  The GPAF and CSCF are managed between DFID and TLC/CA as follows.  DFID sets the strategic direction for the CSCF and the GPAF.  This includes aligning the overarching objectives of the funds to DFID’s Business Plan, agreeing the design of the competition and the funding mechanism and taking final decisions on grant selection.  The Fund Manager runs the funding competition process, including providing support to applicants and undertaking eligibility and initial quality assessments of applications against a criteria agreed with DFID.  Once DFID has selected projects for funding, the Fund Manager provides support to grant holders to put in place robust monitoring and evaluation systems, clear and justified budgets and project plans.  The Fund Manager then oversees the projects for the life of the grant, disbursing funding, monitoring financial and technical performance to ensure projects meet the set standard, and ensuring that any additional grant conditions are met.  The Fund Manager also leads on learning across the Funds to help the sector better understand what works, what doesn’t and why across the objectives supported by the Funds.  ",

The guidance does provide the following principled exceptions:\r\n\r\na) When public disclosure threatens national security interests; b) When public disclosure is likely to jeopardize the personal safety of U.S. personnel or recipients of U.S. resources; c) When public disclosure would interfere with the agency's ability to effectively discharge its ongoing responsibilities in foreign assistance activities; d) When there are legal constraints on the disclosure of business or proprietary information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; e) When the laws or regulations of a recipient country apply to a bilateral agreement and restrict access to information; or f) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nWhen examining information that falls within these categories, USG agencies have sufficient flexibility to protect sensitive information from disclosure, on a case-by-case basis, in order to protect against potential harm while maintaining a strong presumption in favor of transparency. To ensure that these exceptions are rarely applied, and are used appropriately and consistent with the presumption of openness, agencies will maintain specific case-by-case justifications for all instances of reliance on the principled exceptions established in this section. \r\n",

OCT tracks all contributions received from donors to OCHA's annual extra-budget as well as all contributions to 'Specially Designated Contributions' (funds that are managed by OCHA but spent by third parties - including UN agencies and NGOs - for the implementation of humanitarian programmes). OCT tracks contributions from informal 'pipeline', through committed 'pledge' to final payment. It is also the online repository for all donor funding agreements. ",

We are enablers of ecosystem solutions that are transformative to end poverty, marginalisation and create wealth for small-producers and marginalised communities in India and developing nations.   We achieve this through innovation, knowledge and transformative actions, while engaging across grass-root to policy levels. \r\n\r\nWe are here as there are number of societal problems, such as poverty and inequity, marginalisation and vulnerability to diseases, disasters, etc., low capabilities and lack of voice of people, and lack of services and opportunities; and these continue to grow.  Solutions exist, but are usually isolated, verticalised and hardly converge to create impact or reach scale.  We, as social entrepreneurs, try our best to facilitate solutions, rather than leaving it to the Government or to the people themselves. \r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that ‘Sustainable Livelihood Approach’ can be a great lever to address poverty, marginalisation and inclusive development.  It is very important that these approaches are customised to address different forms of marginalisation, people’s needs, aspirations and the local context.  All our design and work starts with ‘People-First and People at the Centre‘– empathy-led designs distinct from technical/ scientific designs.  \r\n\r\nTo us, scale is about reach and impact at the community… how depth and width that we have contributed to and for how long these benefits sustain.   Our solutions should therefore be modelled to take us to the scale. We don’t get satisfied with doing it at a few places or with few people.  We therefore ‘model’ our approaches, ‘cost’ them, and ‘integrate’ them to be adopted by communities or market or public policy.\r\n\r\nWe are passionate about measurement, critiquing ourselves and improve.  We work through result-based planning tools, performance measurement metrics, impact and value for money assessments and use technology where feasible. \r\n\r\nWe current reach out to about 310,000 families, which includes farming households, communities that are vulnerable to HIV, communities that are affected with limited access to drinking water, sanitation and disaster affected.   We work through Four Models of livelihood transformation, which are built on different development approaches for different profiles of people - entitlement-focused models to market based models, and hybrid models. \r\n\r\nWe work across seven states in India, and work through about 162 community based organisations (such as producer companies/ cooperatives, federations of marginalised groups, etc.)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.vrutti.org",
