What is it?

#^index_paragraph1_text
helps you explore IATI data by providing a search function and information by country or by publisher on development activities and budgets published to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI). It is aimed at providing line ministries, parliamentarians and civil society in developing countries with information that can assist with the planning and monitoring of development activities.

#^index_paragraph2_text
d-portal contains current data published through the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as well as the most recent year's data available in the OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System.

#^index_title2_text
Where is the data from?

#^index_paragraph3_text
Data in the dropdown menu is built from the <a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/tree/master/dstore">database</a> which updates everyday at GMT +0 with new data fetched from the IATI Registry.

#^index_paragraph4_text
We list countries that are reported by publishers using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO3166 Alpha-2</a>. For attribution and links to data sources, <a href="about.html#sources">go here</a>.

#^index_paragraph5_text
The list of publishers with their IATI publisher ID comes straight from the IATI Registry database.

#^index_paragraph6_text
The dropdown list of publishers comes from published XML activities reported by these publishers.

#^feedback_paragraph1_text
Hello all and thank you for taking part as beta testers for d-portal.org. We welcome any and all feedback, suggestions and concerns you may have about the website so please feel free to post them as comments below. Overall, we want to focus on legibility and user experience, especially in terms of understanding the data that is being presented.

#^feedback_paragraph2_text
Thank you very much for taking the time to do this! We hope to create something useful and easily deployable, an interesting talking point but most importantly, promote use by those who need the information, and better data quality from reporting organisations.

About d-portal.org

#^about_paragraph_title_text
What is it?

#^about_paragraph1_text
d-portal.org helps you explore IATI data by providing a search function and information by country or by publisher on development activities and budgets published to the platform.

#^about_paragraph2_text
It is aimed at providing line ministries, parliamentarians and civil society in developing countries with information that can assist with the planning and monitoring of development activities.

#^about_paragraph3_text
d-portal contains current data published to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as well as the most recent year's data available in the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/crsguide.htm" target="_blank" class="co">OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System</a>. 

#^about_paragraph4_text
The current platform poses two questions:

#^about_paragraph5_text
In order to answer these questions from a country perspective it is insufficient merely to display available data: it is equally important to show the gaps in the information. Coping with poor quality or missing data is an essential part of the information interface. 

#^about_paragraph6_text
is an open source platform. This means you can use all aspects of the platform to build your own portal using the free source code.

#^about_paragraph7_text
While it currently provides a generic deployment for any country it has been developed with the specific intention of being customised in-country to meet local needs. For further information on how you could create a customised version for a specific country, see <a href="#install" class="how">How to Install</a>.

#^about_paragraph8_text
Funding

#^about_paragraph9_text
The initial development of d-portal.org which ran from Dec 2013 to the Global Partnership meeting in Mexico in April 2014 was funded by <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/" target="_blank" class="co">IATI</a> and <a href="http://devinit.org/" target="_blank" class="co">Development Initiatives (DI)</a>.

#^about_paragraph10_text
IATI is funding current development. If you are interested in funding part of the ongoing development of d-portal, or specific pieces of future development, please contact <a href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org" target="_blank" class="co">support@iatistandard.org</a>

#^about_paragraph11_text
The open source concept relies on sharing resources in the hopes that others will join in and build a better platform together. This includes finding and reporting bugs, contributing new features that you'd like the platform to have or even creating new themes so that others may use it.

#^about_paragraph12_text

Recent, current and future data is presented and compared across data sources.

#^savi_paragraph1_text
SAVi is a simple activity viewer for IATI XML that you can view in real time, online, in your favourite browser.

#^savi_paragraph2_text
SAVi uses CSS and javascript to display otherwise complex-looking XML in a format that is easier to read and digest.

Installing d-portal

#^install_paragraph1_text
At the heart of the d-portal project is the aim that anyone anywhere could take the open source code behind d-portal, deploy it for themselves and create a customised d-portal for any country that interests them.  This could include adding any other data from Aid Information Management Systems, national budgets and a range of comparable socio-economic indicators.

#^install_paragraph2_text
There are already examples of customised country-specific d-portals like 

#^install_paragraph3_text
d-portal is made up of the dstore backend and ctrack interface. To install d-portal, you need to set up a server.

Dash : Publishers statistics for d-portal.org

#^dash_paragraph1_text
Dash is an overview of the data populating d-portal.org with a focus primarily on publisher statistics and the quality of the data reported by them.

#^dash_paragraph2_text
By showing you when and where invalid data is reported, Dash will be able to explain the gaps that are reflected on the main site.

#^dash_paragraph3_text
Dash is not country specific so you will be able to view all of the publisher statistics available across all countries included in the portal. This is to accommodate the fact that there are multiple publishers that report activities in multiple recipient countries.

#^dash_paragraph4_text
Dash is currently accessible at <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?#view=dash">http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?#view=dash</a>. Dash is still being developed.

#^gen_title_text
Generator widgets for your website

#^gen_paragraph1_text
There is a huge amount of interesting information within IATI and significant value in being able to share bite-size pieces of it freely on other websites and blogs. The d-portal generator allows users to select specific information from d-portal and embed it directly into their own website code.

#^gen_paragraph2_text
Once you’ve embedded any content it will update automatically (overnight) as publishers’ data is updated in the IATI registry. When users click on the content they will be directed to the relevant page on d-portal so they can investigate further.

#^gen_paragraph3_text
The generator is currently accessible at <a href="http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html?#view=generator">http://www.d-portal.org/ctrack.html?#view=generator</a>.
