Exciting news for data users - we’ve added some great new search 
features to IATI’s platform d-portal.org. 

The changes (part-funded by <a 
href="https://www.interaction.org/">Interaction</a>) mean that searches 
for IATI data on aid, development and humanitarian activities are 
easier and can be more refined.

**You said, we did...**

We’re grateful to our keen d-portal users for providing useful feedback 
on what needs to be improved. So here’s what has changed:

**1. Choose multiple options**  
Now you can choose more than one option in every category, allowing you 
to find data for multiple recipient countries, publishers and/or 
sectors. 

Here we’re using this new feature to search for spending and activities 
across three sectors relating to health in Liberia.

**2. Search by activity status**  
Want to look at what activities are being planned for the future, or 
see what’s already been implemented? Now you can using our new activity 
status filter.

**3. Free text activity search**  
Want to find a specific activity? Now there’s no need to look through 
many search results, just simply cut and paste the activity ID number 
in the free text box and you’ll be taken straight to that activity’s 
page.

**Other important changes**  
Following requests, users now have the option to order dropdowns 
alphabetically or by IATI code and FAQs on the search functions have 
been added here too.  

**Can we expect more changes to d-portal?** IATI is continually working 
on more ways to ensure people can access the data they want through 
d-portal. Please share any comments or suggestions via <a 
href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal">GitHub</a> or email <a
