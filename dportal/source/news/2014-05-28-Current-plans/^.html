Following an initial period of development in the first quarter of 2014, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBAGH8JKJAU&sns=em">launch at the Global Partnership meeting</a> in April, d-portal is now entering a period of consolidation and consultation.  During this 3-4 month period we are aiming to do the following...

+ Stabilise the code base
+ Enable easy adoption of the code for anyone to create and customise individual country d-portals
+ Allow the addition of other datasets as simply as possible
+ Develop full guidance for those adopting the code 
+ Write up comprehensive documentation and methodology
+ Consult with potential users around the longer term direction for d-portal
+ Consider means of funding and sustaining support and updates for d-portal
