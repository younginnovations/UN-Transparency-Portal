D-portal has <a

million activities</a> in the database.

**_Figure 2._** *Early January with 784540 activities*

This is a huge difference when compared to <a 
href="https://xriss.github.io/D-Portal-Logs/">785,000 at the beginning 
of the year</a> and we expect this number to increase as the months go 
by.

We’ve added the ability for you to download csv data with coordinates 
(<i>as well as other relevant fields</i>).

**_Figure 4._** *Click on the 'View all' link to view more map data*

or publisher profiles by clicking on the link shown above.**

**_Figure 5._** *Click on 'CSV' to start downloading data*

This data can also be further filtered by using the dropdown; ie. 
choosing ‘Active’ will only download ‘Active’ activities.
