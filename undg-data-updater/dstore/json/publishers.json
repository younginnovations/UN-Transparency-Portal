Our primary accountability is to people living in poverty and injustice, but we also balance our accountabilities to donors, supporters, staff and other stakeholders.    ActionAid UK’s income comes from a variety of sources including from our 135,000 individual supporters, trusts and foundations, and institutions like DfID, and the EU. Ongoing regular donations from the public represent a particularly critical element of our funding mix - both in terms of proportion of our global income, but also in terms of its potential for both transformational and focused change.  We use our funding mix holistically to deliver results in the communities in which we work.  In addition, we use unrestricted income for activities which support the International Secretariat which supports 46 countries across the ActionAid Federation. \r\n\r\nIn 2013 we raised £63.7 million, seeing a seven per cent increase in our income.  For every £10 of the money we raised, £7.54 was spent on our charitable activity – £7.00 on our activities overseas and 54 pence in the UK on education outreach to schools and on campaigning. Of the remainder, £1.85 was spent on fundraising and 61 pence on UK support costs. \r\n\r\n \r\nActionAid UK’s data that’s published to the IATI registry is summarised under the six categories above as this corresponds directly with our Trustee Report & Accounts for 2013 (and is therefore based on audited data): \r\n\r\nhttp://www.actionaid.org.uk/about-us/trustees-report-and-accounts.  \r\n\r\nAs we align our IATI reporting with our Trustee Report & Accounts, the bulk of our reporting to IATI is annual.  We report on DfID contracts quarterly.\r\n \r\n",

  "publisher_data_quality": "The data ActionAid UK is publishing to the IATI website is of 2015 income (as in the past) and also expenditure on institutional donors and DEC. This data aligns with ActionAid UK trustee report and accounts 2015. The published data covers all core fields under the IATI/DFID standards. Where income has been accrued as required by SORP 2015, this has been treated as committed as opposed to incoming funds in the data.\r\nAs our income comes from hundreds of thousands of individual people, community groups, trusts and foundations, we have not published their names as we do not have their permission to disclose their identity and details. We therefore have anonymised the data published to the IATI registry where that’s appropriate. Naturally we have disclosed information relating to official income from organisations such as DfID, EU, ECHO, Comic Relief, and Big Lottery. Our income from private individuals (committed giving) involves regular ongoing cash or direct debit payments and a large proportion of our loyal supporter base stay with us for many years. However, the IATI data format requires to enter start and end dates. Given that it is not easy to represent an ongoing income stream in IATI (and after having taken advice from IATI on how best to do this), we have stated start and end dates of 1st January and 31st December against all committed giving. Data for committed giving and Appeals has been summarised by beneficiary code summarised by product, for each month per country e.g. January child sponsorship – Nepal - £XX.\r\nFor expenditure, data has been supplied only for DEC and Govs/EU grants and contract funds. Expenditure and disbursement data has not been provided for Appeals, NGOs, Committed Giving and Other.\r\nAlthough the data in the registry is based on audited data and quality checks have been undertaken before publication, it is possible that there may be some inaccuracies. Please contact transparency@actionaid.org if you have any comments or queries. \r\n",

It is within this premise that the current partnership in HSA4A is built.\r\n",

Over the past three years, the fund has dedicated more than US$ 190 million to increase climate resilience in 28 countries around the world.\r\n \r\n  Climate change is increasing the burdens of the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. \r\n \r\n  Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives\r\n",

  "publisher_description": "The Agência do Zambeze is a public-sector agency under the Ministry of Economics and Finance. The mission of the Agência do Zambeze, which was established in 2010, is to promote the socio-economic and sustainable development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. This Basin comprises 34 districts in four provinces: Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezi. In addition to these districts the Agency’s geographical remit also comprise 6 districts that fall outside the River Basin area. \r\n\r\nFollowing Decree No. 23/2010 of June 2010 the ZVDA is mandated to act in three areas:\r\n\r\n•\tUndertake studies and present strategies for the socio-economic development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. \r\n•\tProvide technical and financial assistance to socio-economic development initiatives in the Lower Zambezi River Basin, including mobilizing funds for such initiatives and channelling them to beneficiaries. \r\n•\tProvide support to local governments in local land use planning and socio-economic development\r\n\r\nThe management of the Agency has taken the strategic decision to facilitate, rather than to implement development projects. By means of national and international tenders, public and private partners are invited to apply to undertake the projects. To a limited extent, ZVDA staff or consultants are charged with project management tasks.\r\n\r\nThe Agency seeks to play a decisive role in coordinating the relationship between the partners, funders, implementing agencies and beneficiaries. Therefore, information collection and sharing, supervision and monitoring of projects and programmes are key tasks.\r\n",

  "publisher_record_exclusions": "IATI exclusion policy\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands values transparency and accountability. Therefore Amnesty International - The Netherlands decided to publish its project data. Amnesty International - The Netherlands commits itself to publish its project data set compliant to the IATI standard. The first IATI compliant project data set will be published at no later than 30-04-2016. The projects that ran in the period 01-01-2016 and 30-03-2016 will be included in the data set. Amnesty International - The Netherlands embraces the principle “Open, unless…”. This means that Amnesty International - The Netherlands remains to have the right to exclude project information from publication to IATI if it falls in one of the following categories:\r\n•\tInformation disclosure affecting relations between partner organization and government/other NGOs (human rights work or work in some conflict affected states);\r\n•\tDetailed specific information affecting and jeopardizing the safety and security of NGO staff, partner staff or beneficiaries;\r\n•\tPersonal information of individual staff and/or partners (e.g. addresses and telephone numbers);\r\n•\tCommercially sensitive information (salaries, consultant fees);\r\n•\tInformation that is exempt under data protection laws or by pre-existing organizational policies.\r\n2. Articles\r\n2.1 General principles for exclusion\r\nExternal relations\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, authorities  or institutions of Amnesty International - The Netherlands, its partners or other donors. All partner organizations and donors\r\nare informed on forehand about Amnesty International - The Netherlands’s policies concerning publishing project data . All the parties have the possibility to request exclusion on forehand, based on the principles in this exclusion policy. Amnesty International - The Netherlands is, at all times, the final decision-maker for the exclusion of data.\r\nSecurity\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data of which it can be expected that it might pose a risk to\r\nthe safety and/or security of any individuals, local Amnesty International - The Netherlands offices, groups of beneficiaries, partner\r\norganizations, donors or suppliers. From a security point of view it was decided to\r\npublish transaction on a cumulative basis per quarter per activity.\r\nPrivacy\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish any information which is traceable to an individual person and that violates that person’s privacy without obtaining prior consent of that specific person involved.\r\nCommercial/Strategic\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that might harm the commercial or strategic interests of Amnesty International - The Netherlands,\r\nits partners, donors or suppliers. Information about the conditions and repayments of loans, investments and guarantees is part of this exclusion and will therefore not be published by Amnesty International - The Netherlands.\r\nLegal/Contractual\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data if we do not have the right to publish the data. Amnesty International - The Netherlands will not publish the data if Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not hold the copyright on particular information or if contractual agreements with back donors or partner organizations impede Amnesty International - The Netherlands’s right to publish the data.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands publishes all project data of projects started after 01-01-2016  or ongoing projects\r\nwith new commitments of more than EUR 25,000 in 2016. \r\nSocial impact\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that possibly harms the social impact of Amnesty International - The Netherlands in general or the related project in particular.\r\nOpenness and transparency about the exclusion policy\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands is transparent about the exclusion policy that Amnesty International - The Netherlands applies to its published IATI compliant data set. This policy is therefore published on the publicly accessible website of Amnesty International - The Netherlands: www.paxvoorvrede.nl.\r\nPublished activities \r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands will report all its projects as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier. However, other information might not be included if one or more categories that are mentioned in this exclusion policy apply. \r\nData Quality\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands values the quality and consistency of its open data. Therefore Amnesty International - The Netherlands publishes only\r\nproject data that meet the minimum requirements. The data quality concerning e.g. reliability will be assessed by program officers. Data that does not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.\r\n3. Decision-making on excluding data\r\nAmnesty International - The Netherlands has the right to exclude data. Information will be disclosed unless a project officer decides otherwise. The responsibility for excluding information is at the level where the information can be assessed in detail. It is possible to exclude a particular project, specific information fields of the IATI standard and/or specific documents from disclosure in the project administration. \r\n4. Review of exclusion policy and quality of data\r\nOn a quarterly basis the planning, monitoring and evaluation department of Amnesty International - The Netherlands will review all data excluded from disclosure. It will be reviewed whether data are rightly excluded and if the exclusion policy is still valid. The exclusion policy will be reviewed and if necessary adjusted on an annual basis.",

This was a huge achievements for the ex bonded labour who were deprived of their rights and entitlements under various alibis for ages. Unfortunately, the lack of effective implementation of the commitment has remained a major challenge and as a result the great majority of ex bonded labour continue to suffer with no sign of relenting. Hence, the project jointly has implemented by the BASE as lead applicant and WVAF as partner organization have envisioned ameliorating the situation that has remained a long overdue. Moreover, the project will also contribute in achieving some of the goals of MDG by addressing the problem of ex-Kamaiya related with child labour and unemployment/underemployment through livelihood support, education, holding duty bearers to account and capacity building of Kamaiya leaders.

  "publisher_description": "Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha (BNPS) is an activist women organization, working since 1986 to establish equality for women from family to state level. BNPS has been working for policy reforms at the national level and organizing and mobilizing grassroots people at the community level through a variety of programs.\r\n\r\nBNPS follows a bottom-up right-based approach linking community level organized efforts with national level to bring reforms. In this linking process its role is one of the catalysts and facilitators. BNPS has been trying to create a supportive environment for the women, minority and other marginalized groups raising their voice and claiming their entitlements through a list of activities, like critical understanding through development education, institution building, livelihood activities and reforms of different policies, system, institution and mindset. The congenial working environment, culture of co-operation and team work, non-hierarchical management with activist orientation has been recognized by all as an asset of BNPS.\r\n\r\nSo far BNPS has directly worked with around 200,000 women and for three decades more than 1,000,000 people from different background involved with the initiatives undertaken by BNPS, and it has been recognized as one of the most dynamic women’s organization in Bangladesh. It focuses on social, economical and political empowerment of women, gender equality, strengthening of local government, electoral reform, education reform and gender budget analysis. In addition, BNPS has been taking up many firm steps on many challenging issues like inheritance laws, women representation in power structure i.e. parliament and local government, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), Prevention of Violent Extremism (PVE), issues of women workers and Violence Against Women and Girls (VAW/G).\r\n\r\nBNPS not only have the expertise and wisdom of working with women towards social, economical and political empowerment but also have the activist tenacity to take a political stand in the face of conservative lobbies for the cause of women and human rights. BNPS has been the pioneer in taking up challenging issues against conservative mindsets, which quiver the root of the extremist fundamentalists and their exploitative network.\r\n\r\nVision: A society free from all sorts of discrimination.   \r\n\r\nMission: Equality through empowerment and social transformation.\r\n\r\nObjective: To carry out its mission, BNPS is striving to eliminate all sort of discrimination against disadvantaged people particularly women from family to society and state consistent with the principles of the constitution of Bangladesh and all human rights instruments of the United Nations.\r\n\r\nCore Values: BNPS has an ideological base with some core values. These are considered as guiding factors that contribute as essential elements in developing all the programs implemented by the organization. The core values of the organization exclusively defined are: • Gender Sensitivity • Secularism • Inclusiveness and • Sustainability with special emphasis on environment",

  "publisher_description": "BRAC is a development success story, spreading solutions born in Bangladesh to 10 other countries around the world – a global leader in creating opportunity for the world’s poor. What started out as a limited relief operation in 1972 in a remote village of Bangladesh has turned into the largest development organisation in the world. Organising the poor using communities’ own human and material resources, BRAC (formerly Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) catalyses lasting change, creating an ecosystem in which the poor have the chance to seize control of their own lives. We do this with a holistic development approach geared toward inclusion, using tools like microfinance, education, healthcare, legal services, community empowerment, social enterprises and BRAC University. Our work now touches the lives of an estimated 135 million people, with staff and BRAC-trained entrepreneurs numbering in the hundreds of thousands, a global movement bringing change to 11 countries in Asia, Africa and the Caribbea\r\n\r\nOur Vision\r\nA world free from all forms of exploitation and discrimination where everyone has the opportunity to realise their potential.  \r\n\r\nOur Mission\r\nOur mission is to empower people and communities in situations of poverty, illiteracy, disease and social injustice. Our interventions aim to achieve large scale, positive changes through economic and social programmes that enable men and women to realise their potential.\r\n",

  "publisher_description": "The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is one of the fastest and most effective ways to support rapid humanitarian response for people affected by natural disasters and armed conflict. CERF receives voluntary contributions year-round to provide immediate funding for life-saving humanitarian action anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nERF pools contributions from donors – mainly governments, but also, foundations, companies, charities and individuals – into a single fund with a $450 million annual target.\r\n\r\nThis money is set aside for immediate use at the onset of emergencies, in rapidly deteriorating situations and in protracted crises that fail to attract sufficient resources.\r\n\r\nIn emergencies, humanitarian organizations apply jointly for funding. Funds are immediately released if these proposals meet CERF’s criteria, i.e. the needs are urgent and the proposed activities will save lives.\r\n\r\nWith money available immediately, relief organizations can deliver food, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other life-saving aid faster and more efficiently.\r\n\r\nCERF allocations are designed to complement other humanitarian funding sources, such as country-based pooled funds and bilateral funding.\r\n\r\nCERF makes money available when it is needed most: at the beginning of a crisis, when time is of the essence and it is critical that emergency relief operations get under way quickly.\r\n\r\nBut mobilizing funds can take time and as time passes, more lives are lost.\r\nCERF helps to remedy this problem with rapid response grants, which can be approved in as little as 48 hours.\r\n\r\nCERF provides funding to the world’s most neglected crises. When a disaster fades from the headlines, or never makes the headlines, it is much harder to raise funds. The need for help, however, is no less significant.\r\n\r\nCERF helps to address this challenge with underfunded emergencies grants, which are disbursed twice a year for emergencies that have not attracted sufficient funding.\r\n\r\nCERF has a loan facility of $30 million. Up to one-year loans are provided based on indication that donor funding is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIn an average year, CERF allocates approximately $450 million to humanitarian operations in some 50 different countries. Since 2006, more than $3.7 billion has been allocated to help millions of people in 92 countries and territories across the world.\r\n\r\nCERF funding is available to UN agencies, funds and programmes and the International Organization for Migration.\r\n\r\nNGOs are important partners in the CERF allocation decision making processes and receive CERF funding when they carry out work for recipient organizations.\r\n\r\nCERF is funded by voluntary contributions. Since 2006, CERF has received almost $3.8 billion from 125 UN Member States and observers, regional and local authorities, and other public and private donors. A third of CERF’s contributors have also received support from the fund.\r\n\r\nThe Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) manages CERF on behalf of the UN Secretary-General.\r\n\r\nThe ERC is supported by the CERF secretariat, which is situated within the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe CERF secretariat is responsible for ensuring that the funds are allocated properly, disbursed in a timely manner, and that use of the funds is reported appropriately and transparently.\r\n\r\nThe CERF Advisory Group provides policy guidance to the Secretary-General on the use and impact of the fund.",

More than 2 billion people live in countries where development is seriously impacted by fragility, conflict and violence.\r\n \r\nCordaid does not accept this world of inequality, exclusion and unsustainability. We envisage a world where the basics of a life in dignity are available to all. Where the poorest and the excluded can influence the decisions that affect them. Where each person is free to flourish and can live in peace.\r\n \r\nCordaid works in the world’s most fragile countries and accomplishes its goals by linking relief and development. Wherever we can we combine lifesaving humanitarian aid with the longer-term improvement of health care systems, economic opportunities and disaster resilience, and the promotion of security and justice.",

  "publisher_description": "The Danish Refugee Council (DRC) is a humanitarian, non-governmental, non-profit organisation founded in 1956 that works in more than 30 countries throughout the world.\r\n\r\nDRC fulfils its mandate by providing direct assistance to conflict-affected populations – refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs) and host communities in the conflict areas of the world; and by advocating on behalf of conflict-affected populations internationally, and in Denmark, on the basis of humanitarian principles and the Human Rights Declaration. We understand \"durable solutions\" as any means by which the situation of refugees can be permanently and satisfactorily resolved, enabling them to live normal lives. Durable solutions can be voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement. In Denmark, DRC assists refugees in all aspects of integration as well as asylum procedures. Internationally, DRC actively participates in supporting the protection of refugees, and promoting durable solutions for conflict-affected populations.\r\n\r\nThe DRC’s supreme authority is the Council, which consists of up to three representatives of each member organisation, six representatives of the voluntary groups and refugee counselling organisations cooperating with the Danish Refugee Council, and of the Executive Committee.\r\nDRC is an umbrella organisation and is currently consisting of 30 organisation members and voluntary groups, committed to the refugee cause. Membership of the DRC is open to non-party-political, voluntary, nationwide humanitarian and international organisations that work on a democratic basis, and whose aims conform to those of the DRC.\r\n\r\nProviding refugees, internally displaced persons and other affected groups in situations of war and conflict with assistance according to their rights. This assistance can consist of relief and other humanitarian aid, rehabilitation and support to return home, as well as contributions to the promotion of durable solutions\r\nContributing to capacity building and co-operation between local and national authorities, as well as other relevant organisations. This work aims at strengthening advocacy and promoting solutions to problems related to situations of conflict, particularly with a view to improving the protection and reintegration of refugees and internally displaced persons\r\nUnder its mandate, DRC International focuses on protection, relief, rehabilitation, post-conflict recovery, capacity-building, humanitarian mine-action, and advocacy. Over the years, DRC has developed particular expertise in relation to the following core sectors:\r\n\r\nHousing and Small-Scale Infrastructure\r\nProduction and Income Generation\r\nFood security & Agricultural rehabilitation and Development\r\nNon-food items; Displacement-related Law and Information\r\nSocial Rehabilitation\r\nCapacity Development of Duty-Bearers and NGOs (including networking)\r\nHumanitarian Mine Action (DDG – Danish De-mining Group)\r\nMost of DRC International’s activities are implemented by DRC programme structures set up locally for the purpose to work with beneficiaries, local authorities and other stakeholders. However, DRC also implements through local partners when this is the best way to meet DRC’s mandate and values. In such cases, DRC is committed to assist the implementing partner strengthen its accountability and capacity.\r\n\r\nDRC International’s activities are funded by money raised from the Danish public and by project grants from the Danish government and other bilateral governmental donors, the European Union, and the United Nations. DRC are also funded by selling advisory and consultancy services related to the humanitarian aid sector.",

With world-class research-based consultancy, we help public and private clients make and implement informed decisions leading to positive impact on society. We support our clients with sound analysis and inspiring ideas, practical solutions and delivery of projects for complex market, policy and management issues.\r\n\r\nIn 1929, businessmen from what is now Erasmus University Rotterdam founded the Netherlands Economic Institute (NEI). Its goal was to bridge the opposing worlds of economic research and business – in 2000, this much respected Institute became Ecorys.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years, Ecorys expanded across the globe, with offices in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Our staff originates from many different cultural backgrounds and areas of expertise because we believe in the power that different perspectives bring to our organisation and our clients.\r\n\r\nEcorys excels in seven areas of expertise:\r\n-  Economic growth;\r\n-  Social policy;\r\n-  Natural resources;\r\n-  Regions & Cities;\r\n-  Transport & Infrastructure;\r\n-  Public sector reform;\r\n-  Security & Justice.\r\n\r\nEcorys offers a clear set of products and services: \r\n-  preparation and formulation of policies;\r\n-  programme management;\r\n-  communications;\r\n-  capacity building;\r\n-  monitoring and evaluation.\r\n\r\nWe value our independence, our integrity and our partners. We care about the environment in which we work and live. We have an active Corporate Social Responsibility policy, which aims to create shared value that benefits society and business. We are ISO 14001 certified, supported by all our staff.\r\n",

Identifying that food is the best medicine, they believed that developing small-scale agriculture is the key to reducing rural poverty. In 1987, Farm Africa started work with nomadic pastoralists in the remote north of Kenya, expanding to Ethiopia a year later.  \r\n\r\nFarm Africa believes that Africa has the power to feed itself and that its smallholders hold the key to lasting rural prosperity. We work directly with farmers to help them unleash their potential to feed Africa’s people.  We pioneer techniques that boost harvests, reduce poverty, sustain natural resources and help end Africa’s need for aid.  \r\n\r\nFarm Africa has 200 staff operating across the east African countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.  Farm Africa’s local staff provide the tools and expertise to enable smallholders in eastern Africa to increase their harvests, whether they farm crops, livestock, fish or the forest.  We train them to be more commercial, adding value to surpluses by milling, drying, or turning their produce into products that fetch a higher price.  With better food for their families and reliable incomes from their businesses, farmers can build for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "publisher_description": "The FMS was created in 2007 to promote women's rights through the investment in women-led organisations. The FMS is the only women’s fund of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay that led women’s groups and movements working to achieve long– term social change. The FMS´s missionis to mobilize financial and technical resources and strengthen organisational capacities of women's organisations in situation of most socio-economic, cultural and environmental disadvantages in Latin America and the Southern Cone, which aim to advance gender equality as the path for a just and equitable social change.\r\n\r\nThe FMS supports women’s groups and organisations and women right’s defenders to advance women’s rights and gender equality in Latin America, with focus on the southern cone sub region. It has two key mandates (i) mobilizing international and local resources and grantmaking towards women’s rights work; (ii) building social movement with capacity development towards social change. \r\n\r\nThe FMS mobilizes resources to support women’s rights groups and organisations through direct and flexible grants from an equal and transparent partnership, based on the conviction that women have enormous potential to be agents of social change. We believe that if women and their organisations are empowered to defend their rights and access to equal opportunities to fulfill their potential, we will contribute with inclusive, participative and sustainable models of development and wellbeing at the community level. \r\n\r\nTo ensure the realization of its mission, the FMS focuses on:  \r\n\r\n-Empowering women’s of most disadvantaged groups decision making and political agency by both strengthening their organizing and advocacy skills and supporting the development of inclusive and democratic leaderships, respectful of diversity and multiculturality and with regional and subregional-wide visions.\r\n\r\n- Supporting exclusively groups and organisations led and composed by women of the most disadvantaged groups in societies and fund controversial and traditionally marginalized and invisibilized issues at the community level; such as labour rights of women workers from precarious sectors like domestic and sewing workers; environmental rights of indigenous women’s rights defenders; criminalization of women’s human rights defenders and activists; LGTTTBI, among others.\r\n\r\n-Influencing community philanthropy and development aid sectors to increase the resources available for women’s human rights initiatives. The ultimate goal is to impact the culture of philanthropy in Latin America from a sustainable, participatory and inclusive development approach with focus on raising awareness about women’s human rights; thus changing the social landscape. \r\n\r\n",

More information about IATI and its objectives is available on the IATI website.\r\n\r\nFree a Girl is first focusing on publishing data on projects receiving funding from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Data from projects with other funding sources and donors are therefore excluded from publication at this stage.  \r\n\r\nFree a Girl adheres to the principle of ‘Open, unless…’, whereby data on project activities are excluded from publication on IATI if the information falls under one of the following categories: \r\n\r\n1.\tProjects that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Netherlands\r\nFree a Girl publishes all projects funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Other projects and programmes are not published in the beginning. This policy will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. \r\n2.\tSafety and security \r\nIf the information disclosed could reasonably pose a threat to the safety and security of any individuals, such as project beneficiaries, partner organisations, Free a Girl staff or donors, it is excluded. This could include but is not limited to, specific locations of project activities and addresses of local partner offices and so forth. \r\n3.\tHarmful for project activities \r\nInformation that would cause harm or jeopardise the implementation or success of project activities is not disclosed. Given the work of Free a Girl in the area of commercial sexual exploitation, this could include information, for example, about targets of future rescue raid operations or advocacy activities.  \r\n4.\tExternal relations\r\nFree a girl does not publish information that may negatively affect relationships with partner organisations, donors and other key stakeholders. Partner organisations and back donors related to projects that are published on IATI are informed of Free a Girl’s policies for publishing project data and can request exclusion. \r\n\r\n5.\tConfidentiality and privacy\r\nInformation that can be traced to an individual, constitutes an invasion of privacy, or may be confidential due to legal, commercial or contractual reasons, is not disclosed. \r\n6.\tCost-effectiveness \r\nFree a Girl does not publish data where the time or monetary costs of obtaining and publishing the data outweigh the expected social impact or public benefit. \r\n7.\tHistory\r\nFree a Girl publishes data from projects funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that commenced after 30 June 2015. Projects prior to this date and that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are excluded at this stage. \r\n\r\nReviews and decision-making \r\nA review of this exclusion policy is conducted on a quarterly basis by the programmes manager and staff, in order to keep abreast of new requirements and changes in internal policies. Decision-making regarding publication of data and exclusions is done by the programmes manager and the director, with assistance from projects staff. \r\n\r\n",

We are inspired by reformers – whether in government, civil society, or the private sector – who work towards the same ideals. Our approach is to collaborate with them whenever possible.\r\n\r\nGlobal Integrity is an innovation lab that produces high-quality research and creates cutting-edge technology to advance the work of a global network of civic, public, and private reformers pursuing increased transparency and accountability in governments.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our core team, we collaborate with a global network of more than 1,300 in-country contributors and partners who take our technologies, tools, and information to where they are most useful – the local level. \r\n\r\n",

  "publisher_description": "As Jordan strives to take its place as a modern country on the world map, education takes an even greater role in raising the future generation. A country with few natural resources, Jordan looks to its human resources as the key element for its success in the markets of the region, and the prosperity, health, and security of its people. Despite the very high enrolment rates and the availability of access to schools across the Kingdom, the quality of education remains uneven. The average achievement in urban areas is higher than that in the rural and more remote areas. One of the major challenges of the Ministry of Education is to provide the schools with the required budget to provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum learning in all schools across the Kingdom. The schools in remote areas lack sufficient electricity to operate daily services such as providing efficient heating and cooling systems within the classrooms lighting the classrooms, connecting computers and online learning, in extreme temperatures and lack of sufficient financial resources to improve the schools’ environment. A further challenge is, the large influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan, since 2011 has increased the load on the Kingdom’s already limited resources. Key drivers of tension between the hosting communities and the refugees at the micro-level are safeguarding livelihoods and competition for income-generating opportunities; the struggle to find adequate, affordable housing; and challenges in the education sector such as difficulty in accessing education and a deteriorating learning environment. The Syrian crisis has exacerbated long-standing structural challenges in the energy sector in terms of supply, demand and management. Securing a sustainable energy pathway for Jordan is more critical today than ever. As per the latest statistics, electricity consumption in the northern governorates (those mostly affected by the Syrian crisis) showed an additional increase of 2.3 per cent compared to other governorates in Jordan. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to contribute to the overall efforts aiming at mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in line with the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) focusing on the Northern governorates (Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid, and North of Balqa’a Governorates) that are most affected by the Syrian crisis. This will be achieved through the use of Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) systems to reduce the growing energy demands improve the learning environment in schools, increase enrollment and retention of Jordanian and Syrian students, improving the livelihood of surrounding communities and promote the social cohesion at the same time. \r\n\r\nProviding the schools with innovative techniques to reduce expenditure in energy bills and generate income will greatly relieve the ministry of the financial burden as well as allowing students, regardless of geographic location and nationality access to a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum academic achievement.\r\n\r\nHorizons is a partner organization alongside Future Pioneers for Empowering Communities (FPEC) and Princess Alia Foundation (PAF).

We support organisations of persons with disabilities to hold their governments to account and advocate for change locally, nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of our work is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD). We promote the effective and full implementation of the UN CRPD, and compliance by governments and the UN System, through the active and coordinated involvement of representative organisations of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and international levels. The 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals are also integral to IDA's work to promote inclusive, sustainable development in line with the UN CRPD and the rights of persons with disabilities.\r\n\r\nWith member organisations around the world, IDA represents the estimated one billion people worldwide living with disabilities. This is the world’s largest – and most frequently overlooked – marginalised group. IDA, with its unique composition as a network of the foremost international disability rights organisations, is the most authoritative representation of persons with disabilities on the global level, and acknowledged as such by the United Nations system both in New York and Geneva.",

We have established a wide network of regional offices in turn connected to thousands of journalists, civil society organisations, government institutions, universities, media groups and regulatory bodies. Our programmes have ranged from rapid-response efforts to stabilise the media sector, to long-term programmes to embed increased citizen engagement, information access and key thematic strands into the regional information ecosystem. This deep-seated knowledge and expertise is further supported by strong relations around the world with influential reform agents within governments and the most senior/respected media stakeholders.

Our staff members in the field quickly identify community needs and respond promptly by distributing ready-to-eat rations and food baskets, as well as by supporting local bakeries.\r\nSustainable Support: IhsanRD supports and sustains local agriculture by providing key resources, such as seeds, fertilizer, fuel, and additional raw materials necessary for successful farming. We conduct training on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) to educate farmers and increase our impact. This training introduces new agricultural technologies, such as “inter-cropping,” which unused land between olive groves optimizing production. \r\n We also conduct programs that provide the most vulnerable households with opportunities to earn income. Through this program, households conduct rehabilitation of community assets in exchange for cash given to vulnerable families.\r\n\r\n* Protection:\r\nThis program focuses on supporting children and victims of gender-based violence.\r\nChild Protection: IhsanRD established several new centers in  Syrian governorates to provide children in need with improved access to quality protection resources. These centers provide structured recreational and psycho-social support, as well as case management services, to affected boys and girls. Our team also manages mobile units to provide recreational psychosocial support to children who cannot access our centers. These units generally administer services in local schools, mosques, community centers, and camps.\r\nGender-Based Violence: IhsanRD delivers services to victims of gender-based violence through safe spaces, which provide women and girls with a safe support network, as well as psycho-social services and vocational training. These programs enable women to find jobs in clinics, hospitals, and local organizations.\r\n\r\n* WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE (WASH)\r\nIhsanRD has significantly increased WASH programs in select areas in Syria to rehabilitate critical water networks and sewage systems. As part of the rehabilitation process, we perform the following activities: • Installing critical hardware, such as generators and pumps • Rehabilitating water storage units • Rehabilitating piping networks destroyed during the conflict  • Supporting operations and maintenance of WASH units in cooperation with Local Councils by providing incentives, toolkits, fuel, and chlorine • Administering technical training • We also train community members to establish cost-recovery systems, and how to collect fees from local households to ensure that communities can continue operating their water systems after IhsanRD withdraws.\r\n\r\n* Education:\r\nThis program focuses on expanding our education efforts in order to reach more children and provide better services. Our projects include: • Rehabilitating and renovating schools • Providing material resources and guides; including Education in Emergencies and Child Safe-Guarding guides for educators • Offering technical support and incentives for teachers and administrators • Delivering kits to teachers and students • Providing heaters and fuel for schools during winter • Conducting training programs on Education in Emergencies, Teachers in Crisis Contexts, Psychosocial Support, Child Safe-Guarding, and other important topics • Organizing awareness sessions for children, based on international standards, that cover various topics, such as avoiding remnants of war, maintaining personal hygiene, and returning to the education system • Managing vocational training centers in traditional school spaces to provide youth with professional skills and to enable them to transition into the job market • Building referral mechanisms within schools to provide vulnerable children with psychological services in cooperation with Ihsan’s Protection team • Establishing safety and security plans and providing schools with safety equipment, such as fire extinguishers and first aid kits.\r\n\r\n* NON-FOOD ITEMS & SHELTER :\r\nThis program focuses on providing life-saving assistance to families fleeing violence or facing harsh weather conditions. Displaced families lack access to basic non-food items. IhsanRD provides essential materials, such as blankets, solar lamps, and mattresses, to the most vulnerable families living in dire conditions. \r\nWe also provide families with tents and manage local centers to support individuals with nowhere to go.\r\nIn addition, we distribute winter kits and clothing through in-kind donations and voucher programs.",

INPUD will expose and challenge stigma, discrimination, and the criminalisation of people who use drugs and its impact on the drug-using community’s health and rights. INPUD will achieve this through processes of empowerment and advocacy at the international level, while supporting empowerment and advocacy at community, national and regional levels.\r\n\r\nINPUD is a movement of people who use drugs (current and former) who support the Vancouver Declaration. The Vancouver Declaration sets out the demands of people who use drugs, emphasising that their human rights must be respected and their health and wellbeing prioritised. INPUD is a global network that seeks to represent people who use drugs in international agencies such as the United Nations and with those undertaking international development work. We believe that people who use drugs should be meaningfully represented in decision-making processes that affect our lives. INPUD is committed to demonstrating at country level how people who use drugs can constructively contribute to the development and delivery of services for our community. We believe that we have a unique insight that can help money be spent wisely thus delivering better results for individuals and the wider community. We are asking the international community to stop always framing us as the problem and instead to recognise that we are part of the solution when is comes to addressing problems associated with drugs and drug policy around the world.",

In 2017 IF incorporated a local affiliate, The Iraq Foundation for Democracy and Human Rights Reinforcement. IF has been working with Internally Displaced women (IDP) across Iraq since 2012, first among families displaced by the sectarian violence of 2006-2008, then with those displaced by the occupation of ISIS. IF provided legal counsel and referral, assistance with documentation, and life-skills education; IF built vocational skills and provided micro-grants to help with livelihood. Since the start of 2017, IF has been working with returnee and IDP women in Nenawa, Anbar, and Salaheddin, through the Empowering Returnee Women project (ERW) where IF trained returnee women in leadership and advocacy skills to be ambassadors for their communities with local authorities and civic leaders. Through individual and group meetings with community women and with local officials, in which needs were discussed and prioritized, women leaders won the trust of both groups of stakeholders, worked with local authorities to provide better services, and were thus able to improve living conditions for their communities.

  "publisher_description": "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is a membership Union uniquely composed of both government and civil society organisations. It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together.\r\n\r\nCreated in 1948, IUCN has evolved into the world’s largest and most diverse environmental network. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its 1,300 Member organisations and the input of some 16,000 experts. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. Our experts are organised into six commissions dedicated to species survival, environmental law, protected areas, social and economic policy, ecosystem management, and education and communication.\r\n\r\nThe ability to convene diverse stakeholders and provide the latest science, objective recommendations and on-the-ground expertise drives IUCN’s mission of informing and empowering conservation efforts worldwide. We provide a neutral forum in which governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples groups, faith-based organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges.\r\n\r\nBy facilitating these solutions, IUCN provides governments and institutions at all levels with the impetus to achieve universal goals, including on biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development, which IUCN was instrumental in defining.\r\n\r\nCombined, our knowledge base and diverse membership make IUCN an incubator and trusted repository of best practices, conservation tools, and international guidelines and standards. As the only environmental organisation with official United Nations Observer Status, IUCN ensures that nature conservation has a voice at the highest level of international governance.\r\n\r\nIUCN’s expertise and extensive network provide a solid foundation for a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects around the world. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people’s well-being. They also produce a wealth of data and information which feeds into IUCN’s analytical capacity.\r\n\r\nThrough their affiliation with IUCN, Member organisations are part of a democratic process, voting Resolutions which drive the global conservation agenda. They meet every four years at the IUCN World Conservation Congress to set priorities and agree on the Union’s work programme. IUCN congresses have produced several key international environmental agreements including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the World Heritage Convention, and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. We continue to help these conventions strengthen and evolve so that they can respond to emerging challenges.\r\n\r\nOur Member organisations are represented by the IUCN Council – the governing body. Headquartered in Switzerland, IUCN Secretariat comprises around 900 staff in more than 50 countries. ",

In 2009, this program evolved into WorldCoaches. With a new name came a focus on combining football training with developing life skills to empower young people and their community. By balancing football training with life skills coaching, a WorldCoach teaches children and youth to become better footballers and at the same time guides them in issues faced in their daily lives. The program focuses on three main pillars: personal development, health and social cohesion.",

We do so by supporting the collective action of women, girls and trans people to control their bodies, make and influence decisions in public and private life, determine how economic and other resources are used, and live free, pleasurable lives. Our goal is to contribute to strong feminist groups and movements that organise together to end inequality and injustice. \r\nBecause courageous women’s, girls’ and trans people’s human rights organisations worldwide need funding and supportive networks in order to grow and transform their communities, Mama Cash mobilises resources from individuals and institutions, makes grants to women’s, girls’ and trans people’s human rights organisations, and helps to build the partnerships and networks needed to successfully defend and advance women’s, girls’ and trans people’s human rights globally. \r\nWe accomplish our work through three key strategies:  Grantmaking and Accompaniment, Strengthening Women’s Funds, and Influencing the Donor Community.",

The below articles describe the principles which guide Mama Cash and its partners to make decisions to publish only parts of the information or to not publish any information of the activity. Mama Cash partners can include additional principles that apply only for their individual publication of data resulting of their activities undertaken.\r\n\r\nGeneral principles for exclusion\r\n1.1 External relations\r\nMama Cash will not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, local institutions, its partners, individuals or (back) donors. All stakeholders are informed upfront about the Mama Cash exclusion policy before publishing data. The stakeholders have a possibility to request exclusion, based on the principles in this exclusion policy which need to be followed up by Mama Cash. Mama Cash is, at all times, the final decision-maker for exclusion of data.\r\n1.2 Security and safety\r\nMama Cash will not publish data of which it can reasonably be expected that it might pose a risk to the physical or psycological safety or security of any individuals, members of staff, groups of beneficiaries, partner organizations, (back) donors or suppliers. \r\n1.3 Privacy\r\nMama Cash will not publish any activity information (photos, names, personal information) that is traceable to an individual person and can reasonably be judged as an invasion of the privacy of that person.\r\n1.4 Legal/Contractual\r\nMama Cash will not publish data if it does not have the right to publish the data or if contractual agreements with (back) donors or partner organisations impede Mama Cash’s right to publish the data.\r\n1.5 Social Impact\r\nMama Cash will not publish data that possibly harm the social impact of their partners in general and/or the activity undertaken by the partner.\r\n1.6 Operational damage\r\nMama Cash will not publish if sharing information on an activity (ties) could be disadvantageous to its success.\r\n1.7 Details\r\nMama Cash will not publish unnecessarily detailed information such as exact dates and locations. The level of detail that can be given depends on the type of activity. Activities which are generally considered safe can be published at the national level while very sensitive activities will be published at the regional level.\r\n1.8  Openness about the exclusion policy\r\nMama Cash will be transparent about the exclusion policy that it applies. This policy will therefore be published on its website. CMI! Consortium members will publish all excluded activities as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier and the total commitments for the activity.\r\n1.9  Data Quality\r\nMama Cash values the quality and consistency of their open data. Therefore Mama Cash will publish only activities data that meet the minimum requirements of secure and liable information. Data that do not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.\r\n2.0 Financal data\r\nMama Cash will publish financial data annually as the costs for publishing/obtaining the data are too high in relation to the relevance of the data for the public. \r\n",

When Dr. Saraswathi Iyer, HoD of Acharya Nagarjuna University joined in one of our Youth Leaders’ Capacity Building, she said, “NewBeginnings is really a New Beginning for the marginalised”\r\nNCT became a registered ngo on 23rd Nov, 2009. It all started when three of the founding members who have long years of professional experience in social works decided to have a ngo that thinks differently and is bold enough to stand with those who are vulnerable. We deliberately choose target groups who are ignored, live in utter poverty for generations; We choose areas where others don’t usually go. We don’t expect sustainability in our projects. We aim at Chain of Sustainable Impact in our projects. What we mean by CSI – the beneficiary of a project should become a benefactor to her/his own neighbour. A trained youth of our project should train another youth in the same vocational skill; a child who is sponsored right now for her education should promise that she would educate another poor child when she is able to earn; a women group which has been trained in how to counsel and avoid domestic violence should talk to women in their neighbourhoods. Thus, we multiply the grant we receive from our donors. \r\nAt the heart of our mission is transparency. A well-organized Management Structure headed by the Governing Body and is well connected to the stakeholders of our programmes.\r\nNewBeginnings has a clearly written down policies and System in place. Be sure, you will be working with a professionally managed organisation: A clearly written down Management policies, Staff polices, Finance Polices, Volunteers’ Policies and Networking Policies etc guide us in our daily work.\r\nWhere there is no hope, we begin to give hope; where people feel that they have come to a dead-end, we want to start again. NewBeginnings gives a New Beginning in every heart; show them a way to live. Life it to the full.  ",

  "publisher_description": "The Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy (NIMD) is a democracy assistance organization that supports political parties in developing democracies. Our approach is characterized by interparty dialogue: we bring parties together and encourage them to cooperate on political issues. This is crucial to establish the right environment for a country’s democratic development.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we assist political parties to become more responsive and policy-focused. We do this by strengthening the programmatic and organizational capacity of the parties. Special attention is paid to empowering members of marginalized groups.\r\n\r\nTo foster the democratic culture in a country, NIMD also provides political education programmes for (aspiring) politicians. These programmes focus on democratic values, knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\nIn general, politicians are much more interested in learning from fellow politicians than from project managers and consultants. Therefore, in all our programmes, we actively stimulate knowledge sharing between politicians by organizing international exchanges and networking events.",

  "publisher_record_exclusions": "1. Introduction\r\nPAX values transparency and accountability. Therefore PAX decided to publish its project data. PAX commits itself to publish its project data set compliant to the IATI standard. The first IATI compliant project data set will be published at no later than 30-04-2016. The projects that ran in the period 01-01-2016 and 30-03-2016 will be included in the data set. PAX embraces the principle “Open, unless…”. This means that PAX remains to have the right to exclude project information from publication to IATI if it falls in one of the following categories:\r\n•\tInformation disclosure affecting relations between partner organization and government/other NGOs (human rights work or work in some conflict affected states);\r\n•\tDetailed specific information affecting and jeopardizing the safety and security of NGO staff, partner staff or beneficiaries;\r\n•\tPersonal information of individual staff and/or partners (e.g. addresses and telephone numbers);\r\n•\tCommercially sensitive information (salaries, consultant fees);\r\n•\tInformation that is exempt under data protection laws or by pre-existing organizational policies.\r\n2. Articles\r\n2.1 General principles for exclusion\r\nExternal relations\r\nPAX does not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, authorities  or institutions of PAX, its partners or other donors. All partner organizations and donors\r\nare informed on forehand about PAX’s policies concerning publishing project data . All the parties have the possibility to request exclusion on forehand, based on the principles in this exclusion policy. PAX is, at all times, the final decision-maker for the exclusion of data.\r\nSecurity\r\nPAX does not publish data of which it can be expected that it might pose a risk to\r\nthe safety and/or security of any individuals, local PAX offices, groups of beneficiaries, partner\r\norganizations, donors or suppliers. From a security point of view it was decided to\r\npublish transaction on a cumulative basis per quarter per activity.\r\nPrivacy\r\nPAX does not publish any information which is traceable to an individual person and that violates that person’s privacy without obtaining prior consent of that specific person involved.\r\nCommercial/Strategic\r\nPAX does not publish data that might harm the commercial or strategic interests of PAX,\r\nits partners, donors or suppliers. Information about the conditions and repayments of loans, investments and guarantees is part of this exclusion and will therefore not be published by PAX.\r\nLegal/Contractual\r\nPAX does not publish data if we do not have the right to publish the data. PAX will not publish the data if PAX does not hold the copyright on particular information or if contractual agreements with back donors or partner organizations impede PAX’s right to publish the data.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nPAX publishes all project data of projects started after 01-01-2016  or ongoing projects\r\nwith new commitments of more than EUR 25,000 in 2016. \r\nSocial impact\r\nPAX does not publish data that possibly harms the social impact of PAX in general or the related project in particular.\r\nOpenness and transparency about the exclusion policy\r\nPAX is transparent about the exclusion policy that PAX applies to its published IATI compliant data set. This policy is therefore published on the publicly accessible website of PAX: www.paxvoorvrede.nl.\r\nPublished activities \r\nPAX will report all its projects as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier. However, other information might not be included if one or more categories that are mentioned in this exclusion policy apply. \r\nData Quality\r\nPAX values the quality and consistency of its open data. Therefore PAX publishes only\r\nproject data that meet the minimum requirements. The data quality concerning e.g. reliability will be assessed by program officers. Data that does not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.\r\n3. Decision-making on excluding data\r\nPAX has the right to exclude data. Information will be disclosed unless a project officer decides otherwise. The responsibility for excluding information is at the level where the information can be assessed in detail. It is possible to exclude a particular project, specific information fields of the IATI standard and/or specific documents from disclosure in the project administration. \r\n4. Review of exclusion policy and quality of data\r\nOn a quarterly basis the planning, monitoring and evaluation department of PAX will review all data excluded from disclosure. It will be reviewed whether data are rightly excluded and if the exclusion policy is still valid. The exclusion policy will be reviewed and if necessary adjusted on an annual basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If the private sector is to be attracted to invest in infrastructure projects in these countries, it will need expert and reliable encouragement and support.\r\n\r\nThrough a group of subsidiary companies (the PIDG Facilities), PIDG offers specialised financing and project development expertise.

  "publisher_description": "ABOUT QRF\r\n\r\n“What the Arab world needs today is an educational revolution; we need a fundamental change that will fulfil every parent’s ambition to provide their child with a quality education.”\r\n\r\nHer Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah, 2013\r\n\r\nFrom its founding in 2013 by Her Majesty Queen Rania of Jordan, the Queen Rania Foundation (QRF) has aimed to be the premier resource on educational issues, in Jordan and around the Arab world, and to act as an incubator for new ideas and initiatives. In the firm belief that education is the foundation of economic, political and social development, QRF’s mandate has focused on identifying gaps and opportunities for developing new education programs, with the aim of influencing policy and creating educational change on the ground. QRF’s focus is perhaps best exemplified through the launch of Edraak.org an online education platform that localized open source technology developed by Harvard and MIT to reach over a million learners across the Arab world with free high quality educational material in less than 3 years.\r\n\r\nThe Middle East region is now the world’s largest producer and host of forced displacement. With the number of refugees and displaced people across the Middle East reaching almost 15 million, QRF believes it is imperative now more than ever to reinvent education from the ground up. Education must suit the needs of a shifting geopolitical landscape and a more mobile population – forced or otherwise.\r\n\r\nRe-inventing School Education\r\nJordan and the Middle East region are at a critical point. Whereas others may choose to dwell on the challenges, Her Majesty has always maintained that “Pessimism doesn’t change the reality; it prolongs the status quo… Optimism and faith coupled with pragmatism change the reality”. It is imperative upon the people of Jordan and the region to embrace the current status quo as an opportunity to disrupt existing legacy systems of education, healthcare, and infrastructure. In that light, and in response to the incoming waves of refugee children in Jordan, QRF aims to position Jordan as the ideal setting to reinvent school education through an impact focused approach to learning.\r\n\r\nOver the next 5 years, QRF will focus on a subset of public schools that are hosting both Jordanian and Syrian refugee students, combined with learners that are out of school for a number of factors. The Foundation will aim to reach 150,000 school-age students between 3 and 15 years of age with teacher-targeted localized innovative solutions that improve learner’s socio-emotional skills, numeracy, and literacy.\r\n\r\nTo successfully disrupt the education sector, it will be critical to start at the bottom of the pyramid where resources are constrained and there is an imperative to do more with less. QRF will identify and channel funding to the most suitable innovations (technological or otherwise), localize them when necessary, and run rigorous assessments for impact. The defining aspects of QRF’s approach are the focus on rigorous evaluation methods to “solve for impact” and the mixed funding approach to ensure that both public and private sector thinking can be combined to solve these critical challenges. Successful deployments will then be scaled via public-private partnerships across the Jordanian public school system. QRF will widely share the results of all of its interventions to ensure that any lessons learned are accessible to educators and learners across the globe –especially those working within developing settings and forced migration challenges.\r\n\r\nWithin its target schools, QRF will center on 5 areas for its interventions. The focus areas have been identified through a rigorous research process using internal and external experts to ensure limited resources are directed to the issues with the highest potential for impact on learning and society. The five focus areas are: improving learning outcomes for boys, creating more structured classroom pedagogy, introducing regular formative assessment, creating strong school leadership and positive culture, and raising parental awareness and engagement in the early years of a child’s life.  These focus areas will be buttressed by three crosscutting themes that have always been central to QRF’s operations and interventions: a clear understanding of the transformative power of technology (and its limitations), provision of a healthy socioemotional school climate, and finally ensuring selected interventions are readily scalable on national levels.\r\n\r\nAs a small country, with very little resources, and in a turbulent region, Jordan has always relied on the support of visionary friends and partners to help it develop into a model of stability and moderation across the region. In the same vein, QRF seeks the support of the international community and leaders in the public and private sector to help it transform Jordan into the ideal setting to catalyze education for the developing world and especially the Middle East region. As stability returns to war torn countries such as Yemen, Libya and Syria there will need to be clear models of education that can help them make up for lost time.",

Attention for the community in which children grow up is essential to do justice to all of these aspects. We encourage communities to participate and contribute to the content of our programs.\r\nOut of principle Red een Kind chooses to work with local partner organisations that have their roots in the area. In our view local organisation are the key to good relationships with the local community. We devote much time and attention to equipping and coaching our partners in order to bring about effective change. Our strategy is set out in a ‘Theory of Change’.",

People must have access to fair and effective paths to address the grievances and inequalities that drive conflict, and people with influence should exercise their power to promote just and equitable societies.\r\nTogether with our partners, we use expertise and tested methodologies founded on over 28 years of experience. We work with people affected by conflict to improve their safety and sense of security, and we conduct wider research and analysis. We use this evidence and learning to improve local, national and international peacebuilding policies and practices that can help build lasting peace. Our priority is people – we believe that everyone should be able to lead peaceful, fulfilling lives, free from insecurity and violent conflict.",

Publication on certain activities may be pending, subject to official notification of donor permission. As above, in our IATI publications an activity is an individual grant or contract, broken down by country or region of implementation. In our internal systems, multi-country grants and contracts are set up as internal ‘funding streams’ with ‘child’ awards for each country. We do this in order to facilitate financial reconciliations between country offices. Due to the way information is held within our systems, ‘parent’ funding streams and their child awards are all published as separate IATI activities, with their relationship indicated using IATI’s ‘related activity’ elements. The parent funding stream IATI activity will not have certain fields/elements (description, sector, recipient-country/region, document-link and records of expenditure). These are published on the child award’s IATI activity file only. Our systems do not easily map against the IATI categories for completion / post-completion, therefore we have adopted ‘implementation’ to cover all award activity (e.g. programme activity may have ended but financial reconciliation, etc. is still ongoing). Therefore in some instances an award status may display as ‘implementation’ even after its planned end date.",

Save the Children International is part of the global Save the Children organisation, which is made up of 28 separate national entities and one Save the Children International who design, implement and evaluate international programmes.

Therefore we will not publish any information that could identify any individual. More information can be found in our Child Safeguarding Policy.

  "publisher_constraints": "We have provided all information that our systems currently permit as well as other data that we have been able to add within reasonable cost. Publication on certain activities may be pending, subject to official notification of donor permission. \r\n\r\nAs above, in our IATI publications an activity is an individual grant or contract, broken down by country or region of implementation. In our internal systems, multi-country grants and contracts are set up as internal ‘funding streams’ with ‘child’ awards for each country. We do this in order to facilitate financial reconciliations between country offices. Due to the way information is held within our systems, ‘parent’ funding streams and their child awards are all published as separate IATI activities, with their relationship indicated using IATI’s ‘related activity’ elements. The parent funding stream IATI activity will not have certain fields/elements (description, sector, recipient-country/region, document-link and records of expenditure). These are published on the child award’s IATI activity file only. In addition, incoming funds may only be recorded against the parent activity (the initial way our systems were set up). In late 2016 we introduced recording of income against the child activity as well (to be phased in across live and new awards). \r\n\r\nOur systems do not easily map against the IATI categories for completion / post-completion, therefore we have adopted ‘implementation’ to cover all award activity (e.g. programme activity may have ended but financial reconciliation, etc. is still ongoing). Therefore in some instances an award status may display as ‘implementation’ even after its planned end date. In December 2017 we published our first set of result for some of our DFID-funded work and will continue to increase the range of activities for which we publish results.",

And we challenge global leaders to keep the promises they’ve made to transform the world for children.

This means that some fields may be excluded on some activities. \r\n\r\nAs a rights-based organisation we have a commitment to safeguard children, especially those with whom we are in contact.  Therefore we will not publish any information that could identify an individual child.  More information can be found in our Child Safeguarding Policy.  \r\n\r\nWe may also exclude any politically or culturally sensitive information that may hinder our ability to operate in certain locations, including information that could put at risk the safety and security of beneficiaries, staff and partners.

Our work supports people with deafblindness on a journey from isolation to independence, ensuring people that they have the economical, emotional, health and educational support to become active and valued members of their communities. Our work is guided by the following principles:\r\n• We work in partnership with governments, and NGOs to build the capacity of state education and health services to include children with deafblindness to access essential services.\r\n•We work with the families and communities to combat stigma, provide support and show people how to include children with deafblindness in family and community activities. \r\n• We work to influence governments to fulfil the rights of people with deafblindness and to immunize against Rubella, which is the leading cause of deafblindness in East Africa\r\n• We train parents and professionals on how to provide therapy and education for children with deafblindness.",

The Foundation’s vision is to “improve the lives of disadvantaged children and their communities globally”. This aspiration is realised through a range of initiatives designed to tackle development challenges in some of the poorest countries in the world.  Through a range of approaches, Stars aims to support local actors to address problems they identify by providing access to funding and non-financial support. \r\nStars believes that well-run local organisations are best placed to respond to the needs of their communities and the young people in their care. All too often however, they are constrained by a rigid approach to partnerships and funding which can limit their effectiveness. \r\nStars’ flagship activity is the annual ‘Impact Awards’ which recognise and reward effective and well-managed local organisations working in the fields of child health, education, protection and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene). Stars aims to select a winner and runner-up in each field across three regions: Africa-Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America-the Caribbean. The Awards are open to applications from the 100 countries with the highest rates of under-five mortality (http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/apply/eligibility-2/). ",

Founded in Paris in 1920, the core strengths of the organization are in technical assistance, operational research and education, addressing the challenges of tuberculosis (TB), lung disease, HIV/AIDS and tobacco control in low and middle-income countries. The Union offers technical assistance; provides education and training opportunities, including international and regional conferences; and supports operational research and other research and publications. The Union also raises awareness about health issues. The Union works in approximately 80 countries every year and is both an international scientific institute, with 11 offices worldwide, and a federation of some 3,400 individual and organizational members in 150 countries. The Union maintains relationships with the World Health Organization, the United Nations, and other nongovernmental institutions in the health and development sectors",

It serves as a knowledge centre, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of corruption and new approaches to tackling it.\r\n\r\nThe secretariat works to build coalitions. These efforts bring a wide variety of representatives together, including policy makers, citizens, companies and the media. Transparency International has played a crucial role in bringing about and bolstering anti-corruption initiatives, such as the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, UN Convention against Corruption and UN Global Compact.\r\n\r\nThe secretariat’s relationship with chapters is one of mutual support. Drawing on our broad-based expertise, the secretariat helps chapters develop the tools and techniques needed to address corruption in their countries. Our secretariat also facilitates the increase of financial and human resources, so that chapters are ever more effective in the fight against corruption.

The U.S. Government will continue to publish IATI compliant data in the following three ways:  (1) Activity level data on a quarterly basis will be published for approximately 70% of total ODA by the end of 2013.  The coverage is expected to increase to approximately 90% of total ODA by the end of 2014, with 100% of all ODA flows reporting all available IATI compliant data expected by the end of 2015.

The guidance does provide the following principled exceptions:\r\n\r\na) When public disclosure threatens national security interests; b) When public disclosure is likely to jeopardize the personal safety of U.S. personnel or recipients of U.S. resources; c) When public disclosure would interfere with the agency's ability to effectively discharge its ongoing responsibilities in foreign assistance activities; d) When there are legal constraints on the disclosure of business or proprietary information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; e) When the laws or regulations of a recipient country apply to a bilateral agreement and restrict access to information; or f) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nWhen examining information that falls within these categories, USG agencies have sufficient flexibility to protect sensitive information from disclosure, on a case-by-case basis, in order to protect against potential harm while maintaining a strong presumption in favor of transparency. To ensure that these exceptions are rarely applied, and are used appropriately and consistent with the presumption of openness, agencies will maintain specific case-by-case justifications for all instances of reliance on the principled exceptions established in this section. \r\n",

The guidance does provide the following principled exceptions: a) When public disclosure threatens national security interests; b) When public disclosure is likely to jeopardize the personal safety of U.S. personnel or recipients of U.S. resources; c) When public disclosure would interfere with the agency's ability to effectively discharge its ongoing responsibilities in foreign assistance activities; d) When there are legal constraints on the disclosure of business or proprietary information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; e) When the laws or regulations of a recipient country apply to a bilateral agreement and restrict access to information; or f) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations. When examining information that falls within these categories, USG agencies have sufficient flexibility to protect sensitive information from disclosure, on a case-by-case basis, in order to protect against potential harm while maintaining a strong presumption in favor of transparency. To ensure that these exceptions are rarely applied, and are used appropriately and consistent with the presumption of openness, agencies will maintain specific case-by-case justifications for all instances of reliance on the principled exceptions established in this section.",

Although the title of the document is Budget of the U.S. Government, it represents proposals for congressional consideration.

  "publisher_description": "Vrutti is a Centre for sustainable livelihoods enhancing people’s well-being.  We are enablers of ecosystem solutions that are transformative to end poverty, marginalisation and create wealth for small-producers and marginalised communities in India and developing nations.   We achieve this through innovation, knowledge and transformative actions, while engaging across grass-root to policy levels. \r\n\r\nWe are here as there are number of societal problems, such as poverty and inequity, marginalisation and vulnerability to diseases, disasters, etc., low capabilities and lack of voice of people, and lack of services and opportunities; and these continue to grow.  Solutions exist, but are usually isolated, verticalised and hardly converge to create impact or reach scale.  We, as social entrepreneurs, try our best to facilitate solutions, rather than leaving it to the Government or to the people themselves. \r\n\r\nWe strongly believe that ‘Sustainable Livelihood Approach’ can be a great lever to address poverty, marginalisation and inclusive development.  It is very important that these approaches are customised to address different forms of marginalisation, people’s needs, aspirations and the local context.  All our design and work starts with ‘People-First and People at the Centre‘– empathy-led designs distinct from technical/ scientific designs.  \r\n\r\nTo us, scale is about reach and impact at the community… how depth and width that we have contributed to and for how long these benefits sustain.   Our solutions should therefore be modelled to take us to the scale. We don’t get satisfied with doing it at a few places or with few people.  We therefore ‘model’ our approaches, ‘cost’ them, and ‘integrate’ them to be adopted by communities or market or public policy.\r\n\r\nWe are passionate about measurement, critiquing ourselves and improve.  We work through result-based planning tools, performance measurement metrics, impact and value for money assessments and use technology where feasible. \r\n\r\nWe current reach out to about 310,000 families, which includes farming households, communities that are vulnerable to HIV, communities that are affected with limited access to drinking water, sanitation and disaster affected.   We work through Four Models of livelihood transformation, which are built on different development approaches for different profiles of people - entitlement-focused models to market based models, and hybrid models. \r\n\r\nWe work across seven states in India, and work through about 162 community based organisations (such as producer companies/ cooperatives, federations of marginalised groups, etc.)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.vrutti.org",

  "publisher_description": " \r\n\r\nWOMEN’S ACTION GROUP PROFILE\r\n\r\n1.\tBackground\r\nWomen’s Action Group (WAG) was founded in 1983. It was the violation of the human rights of black women by a black government which gave birth to this organisation. WAG was formed following the arrest and incarceration of over 6 000 women from October to December 1983 under Operation Clean up and its purpose was to round up single women and charge them as prostitutes. Thousands of women were arrested and detained. It was the arbitrary arrest and denial of freedom for the women of Zimbabwe that saw a handful of ordinary women taking up the fight against injustice. Since then, WAG never looked back on advocating for women’s rights. The organisation was registered as an Educational Trust in 1987 and has gained consultative status with the United Nations’ Economic and Consultative Social Council (ECOSOC). \r\n1.1 Vision\r\nWAG’s vision is a Zimbabwe with empowered women and girls claiming and enjoying their rights in a situation of transformed power relations between women and men. The core purpose of the organisation is to champion women’s rights in Zimbabwe.\r\n1.2 Mission statement\r\nWAG’s mission statement is to develop products and tools for unlocking women’s power to claim and enjoy their rights in violence free and rights conscious communities.  The main programme areas for WAG include HIV & AIDS, Sexual reproductive health and rights and Gender based violence. \r\n1.3 Core purpose\r\n   WAG’s core purpose is to champion women’s rights in Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\n2.\tProgramme thematic areas\r\n2.1 HIV AND AIDS\r\nThe programme advocates for specific   HIV and AIDS policies that are sensitive to the needs of women and girls as well as empowering them to assert their rights to safer sex to prevent HIV infection   \r\nObjectives \r\n•\tTo raise awareness among communities particularly women and girls on  HIV and AIDS , gender and negative cultural practices increasing women’s vulnerability to HIV and AIDS\r\n•\tTo advocate for policies on HIV and AIDS, that are sensitive to the specific needs of women and that promote quality health service provision for women\r\n•\tTo empower women through information sharing to assert their right to safer sex to prevent HIV infection\r\n•\tTo actively participate in national, regional and international processes on HIV and AIDS and articulate the concerns of women, as part of the global response to HIV and AIDS\r\n\r\n2.2 GENDER BASED VIOLENCE\r\n\r\nThe programme touches on all aspects of women’s lives (public and private domain). The battle to free women from violence is fought on many angles including legislative reform, legal advice, counselling and representation and awareness raising campaigns. \r\nObjectives\r\n•\tTo increase national awareness on the negative impact of gender based violence on women and girls.\r\n•\tTo empower communities  particularly women to fight and prevent gender based violence in their lives\r\n•\tTo advocate for policies and laws that address gender inequalities and gender based violence\r\n•\tTo contribute to international, regional and national strategies and interventions to eradicate gender based violence\r\n2.3 SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RIGHTS  \r\nWAG is focusing on the Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights programme to promote strategies that respect the sexual and reproductive health rights and needs of women and girls.\r\nObjectives\r\n•\tTo promote gender equality in sexual and reproductive health and rights\r\n•\tTo lobby for access to quality health care services in Zimbabwe\r\n•\tTo raise community awareness and encourage them to come up initiatives and strategies that promote sexual and reproductive health and rights\r\n•\tTo contribute to national, regional and international strategies and interventions to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights\r\n2.4 AREAS OF OPERATION\r\nAll the three programmes operate at community and national level. WAG engages in awareness raising campaigns and training on addressing the intersections of HIV, gender based violence and women’s rights. WAG engages communities in dialogue on issues that affect them and come up with their own initiatives and solutions that promote the enjoyment of women’s rights. \r\nWAG also focuses on lobbying and advocacy for gender sensitive laws and policies. The organisations also works closely with the policy makers (the women’s caucus, parliamentary portfolio on health) to ensure that they commit to the international and regional instruments on women’s rights that Zimbabwe has ratified.\r\n\r\n3.\tTechnical expertise\r\nWomen’s Action Group has experience in the field of gender equality and gender-based violence programming having worked in 26 Districts under the Integrated Support Programme (ISP) on prevention of GBV. Under the same programme, WAG demonstrated its expertise in capacity building through training of Behaviour Change Facilitators (BCFs) on integrating GBV in HIV programming in 13 Districts. WAG also made an input into the GBV training manual that was developed for BCFs. WAG has also demonstrated its training expertise through multi-sectoral training in 26 ISP Districts that resulted in the development of District level referral pathways for the 26 Districts. WAG has also developed training material for other programmes on gender equality such as the training manual for Community Based Advocates under the UN Women H4+ programme and has also developed GBV training manuals for training of service providers, civil society organisations and Community Based Advocates under the Amplify Change programme. WAG also has dedicated staff who have technical expertise in gender equality programming. Of particular interest has been WAG’s contribution to national priorities and its commitment to preventing GBV as one of its key strategic objectives under the current and past organisation strategic frameworks.\r\nOne of WAG’s flagship that has been championed over the years has been the production of booklets and the Speak Out magazine which requires fluency in both English and Shona as well as writing and editorial expertise. Through the production of other materials such as training manuals, WAG has also improved their ability to write concisely and produce material that has been shared globally through the website and other media channels. \r\nOther key competencies \r\nWAG believes that with teamwork the organisation can achieve greater results as individuals have diverse expertise. WAG also has respect for diversity having worked with diverse groups of people across ethnic backgrounds and lifestyles. The current programmes on gender equality requires WAG to have the aptitude to fit in different societies with different cultures and religions such as the Tonga people, apostolic sects, sex workers and persons with disabilities while maintaining respect of their differences.  WAG also values communication as a key component in coordinating programmes and have reputable communication structures with its partners. WAG has a good track record in delivering programme objectives and this has been demonstrated through its commitment to achieving results in all programmes undertaken. \r\n \r\n4.\tStaff Skills\r\nSpeciality Area\tPublic Health Expert and RH and Gender Specialist (Director)\tGBV Officer  Expert\tM and E Officer\r\nExperience in Public Health in Zimbabwe\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\nCommunication  skills   \r\n\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\nAppreciation of  SRHR \t√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\nKnowledge of GBV \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\nKnowledge  of HIV & AIDS\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\nTraining skills \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\nDevelopment of manuals  \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\nAbility to research, analyse, evaluate, synthesize and present information \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\nWriting skills \t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\nFacilitating meetings and innovative/effective methodologies\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\t√√√√√\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Creative activities generate positive energy, give children and young people new skills that they can be proud of and provide instant fun. They learn to overcome their fears, develop confidence, and find a way to deal with their experiences. Through active participation in our projects, children and young people, including the most vulnerable, are able to express their views freely and have a say in decision-making. As a conflict-sensitive organisation, War Child Holland ensures its actions and projects do not negatively influence a conflict.",
